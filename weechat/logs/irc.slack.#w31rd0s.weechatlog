2017-10-19 02:28:42	dougsmith	It looks like the feeds are merged but you interact with one selected channel within those for viewing nick lists / sending messages.
2017-10-19 02:29:01	dougsmith	My weechat bar does this by default with my servers.
2017-10-19 02:29:15	ccarball	how long u been using weechat?

2017-10-19 02:47:11	dougsmith	This could be collaborating on PR's to opensource things, or our own original ideas.
2017-10-19 02:47:29	dougsmith	Let split the hogs of war(on closed source)!
2017-10-19 02:48:00	8bit	Good point: it's only PR's not just commits

2017-10-19 10:50:26	ccarball	Catalina Marie Vajiac will be on campus today until around 6pm 
2017-10-19 10:50:26	ccarball	If you would like to make an appointment to see her, please contact her secretary, Camila G Carballo, via slack or mobile phone.
2017-10-19 10:50:26	ccarball	Ms. Vajiac will be available all day, however, she will be accompanied by her secretary throughout any appointments made (except between the hours of 12:30pm and 1:30pm) 
2017-10-19 10:50:26	ccarball	Therefore, if you would prefer a private meeting with Ms. Vajiac, perhaps that middle hour of the day would suit you best.

2017-10-19 23:33:46	ccarball	alitteke: LOLOLOLOL
2017-10-19 23:59:52	dougsmith	@alitteke: Small detail, I upgraded to a motorized unicycle b/c it better represents the unix philosophy
2017-10-20 00:02:25	alitteke	Which tenant of the philosophy does that serve?
2017-10-20 00:02:31	8bit	that sounds like approximately the most dangerous invention I've ever heard
2017-10-20 00:02:46	alitteke	I don’t think it’s doing any one part well...
2017-10-20 00:02:57	alitteke	Unless the unicycle is part of a bicycle
2017-10-20 00:05:25	8bit	depends on the goal
2017-10-20 00:05:48	8bit	if the goals are severe injuries and efficiency, I'd say it does both wonderfully
2017-10-20 00:05:56	alitteke	Or death I suppose
2017-10-20 00:07:06	ccarball	TIL a car is just a large bicycle
2017-10-20 00:07:34	ccarball	SOME PEOPLE, however, refuse to agree that this is the case
2017-10-20 00:07:49	alitteke	It’s got four wheels
2017-10-20 00:08:29	alitteke	Therefore, not bicycle
2017-10-20 00:10:22	catvajiac	bicycle with lots of training wheels?
2017-10-20 00:10:36	ccarball	^^^^
2017-10-20 00:10:42	ccarball	yes exactly what i said catvajiac 
2017-10-20 00:11:17	catvajiac	where is this coming from tho
2017-10-20 00:11:37	catvajiac	i need CONTEXT so i can SWITCH to this topic properly
2017-10-20 00:11:39	catvajiac	zing
2017-10-20 00:12:24	alitteke	No, becusss training wheels have different sizes
2017-10-20 00:12:28	alitteke	Because
2017-10-20 00:12:53	alitteke	Plus, a big bicycle is just a motorcycle
2017-10-20 00:13:35	jcioffi	woo I'm 21

2017-10-21 14:31:23	8bit	has anyone here gotten unity on linux?
2017-10-21 14:31:26	8bit	I haven't tried yet

2017-10-21 14:31:36	noah.y	I have it on windows
2017-10-21 14:31:38	alitteke	Programming is musical not popular, therefore it is C-Sharp

2017-10-21 14:32:47	8bit	I've always hated c-sharp
2017-10-21 14:32:50	8bit	Like, the note
2017-10-21 14:32:52	8bit	not the language
2017-10-21 14:32:57	noah.y	Same
2017-10-21 14:33:03	noah.y	It hurts me delicate ears
2017-10-21 14:33:08	alitteke	I prefer cminor

2017-10-21 14:36:55	catvajiac	panics
2017-10-21 14:37:25	dougsmith	8bit: Sax C# is naturally out of tune on some makes of the instrument. Pros are the ones who know the alternate fingering that brings their make back in tune.
2017-10-21 14:37:54	dougsmith	Can't hate the c sharp to hard, I'm a huge b-flat blues guy.
2017-10-21 14:38:24	dougsmith	catvajiac: at least you know how to panic. Start there and build.
2017-10-21 14:38:35	catvajiac	panic is a terrible foundation
2017-10-21 14:38:42	ccarball	panic! at the disco

2017-10-21 14:41:17	8bit	not sure i can claim to if i haven't done it in so long
2017-10-21 14:42:32	ccarball	8bit: err no
2017-10-21 14:43:55	dougsmith	catvajiac: Panic - Terrible foundation,  great motivator
2017-10-21 14:43:55	dougsmith	ccarball: Panic! At the Disco - Good songs, inconsistently released
2017-10-21 14:43:55	dougsmith	noah.y: Unity Games: Why not? We have enough time to learn them. Though I want to do something on-theme...
2017-10-21 14:43:55	dougsmith	8bit: Saxophone - like riding a bike, can never be forgotten. Claim it, and definitely plan to jam in the future if the mood strikes you. [cc: ccarball]
2017-10-21 14:44:55	dougsmith	There are now four conversations in this buffer.
2017-10-21 14:44:58	noah.y	What’s the theme?
2017-10-21 14:45:08	dougsmith	Hasn't been released.
2017-10-21 14:45:18	dougsmith	At least not that I can find.
2017-10-21 14:45:20	8bit	I love interleaving conversations
2017-10-21 14:45:23	noah.y	Wasn’t there a prize for best use of oculus at tigerhacks
2017-10-21 14:45:26	noah.y	Or something
2017-10-21 14:45:28	8bit	is there now five since one is a meta convo
2017-10-21 14:45:45	8bit	ccarball: what did you err no to [cc: ccarball]
2017-10-21 14:46:04	dougsmith	I would love to write a filter that forks/flags buffers by content, so I guess I'm the opposite.
2017-10-21 14:46:32	8bit	dougsmith: I picked my sax up once over break and my tone was so bad
2017-10-21 14:46:34	8bit	I was sad
2017-10-21 14:46:40	dougsmith	noah.y: Either that or a general IOT prize, but I'm not sure how sponsor prizes work.
2017-10-21 14:46:59	dougsmith	8bit: _adage about practice_
2017-10-21 14:47:45	8bit	you can't _adage about bikes_ and then _adage about practice_
2017-10-21 14:48:25	catvajiac	i have 6 in this buffer
2017-10-21 14:48:47	dougsmith	catvajiac: Convos? Or threads?

2017-10-21 14:50:05	ccarball	4 hastags in this buffer
2017-10-21 14:50:39	dougsmith	Oh, by convos I meant active topics of discussion being discussed.
2017-10-21 14:50:55	dougsmith	I think the technical term for hashtags is groups
2017-10-21 14:52:23	ccarball	well then 4 groups
2017-10-21 14:52:30	ccarball	plus 4 convos in one of those groups
2017-10-21 14:52:34	ccarball	eeh too many words
2017-10-21 14:52:57	 *	ccarball is cannot interact
2017-10-21 14:53:35	dougsmith	I think this is just a classification problem, interaction is left as an exercise to the reader.
2017-10-21 14:54:44	ccarball	dougsmith: so if I just make strange noises and hide in my shirt does that count as interaction?
2017-10-21 14:55:37	dougsmith	Not the focus of this discourse, so I implicitly have no opinion.
2017-10-21 14:58:58	ccarball	dougsmith: but it was a direct question and you must answer
2017-10-21 14:59:54	dougsmith	I'm sorry, this recording has a limited range of responses, you have to ask the right questions.
2017-10-21 15:00:21	dougsmith	Nowhere is it written that I _have_ to respond to anything?
2017-10-21 15:00:30	8bit	ccarball: that is my primary form of interaction [cc: ccarball]
2017-10-21 15:00:33	ccarball	!dougsmith what is interaction?

2017-10-24 17:45:36	dougsmith	On what planet it the set of feelings equivalent to the set of negative feelings about oneself?
2017-10-24 17:45:55	dougsmith	And on this planet is it not impossible to have feelings that aren't self-deprecating.
2017-10-24 17:46:23	ccarball	crying implies there are negative feelings, if those negative feelings are directed toward oneself, then it is self.deprecation()
2017-10-24 17:46:34	ccarball	_drops mic_
2017-10-24 17:46:45	ccarball	_picks mic back up because expensive_
2017-10-24 17:47:14	dougsmith	You've proven overlap and sold it as set equivalence
2017-10-24 17:47:14	dougsmith	_Claps slowly, like a dolphin_
2017-10-24 17:47:23	dougsmith	_Goes back to work_
2017-10-24 17:47:41	dougsmith	Also pnutzh4x0r said nothing about a recurcsive call to DeprecateDoug(). I run on a functional kernel.
2017-10-24 17:49:16	ccarball	what can I say? I'm a good saleswoman
2017-10-24 17:50:12	8bit	god, a functional kernel?
2017-10-24 17:50:24	8bit	that sounds like hell...or heaven, i'm not sure
2017-10-24 17:50:53	8bit	but i tend to agree with dougsmith, crying isn't sufficient for self deprecation
2017-10-24 17:53:10	dougsmith	Also, does anyone use a nonstandard browser?
2017-10-24 17:53:26	8bit	sorta
2017-10-24 17:53:33	8bit	I play around with nonstandard browsers
2017-10-24 17:53:39	ccarball	nope
2017-10-24 17:53:42	ccarball	chromium for me
2017-10-24 17:53:53	dougsmith	Are any of them javascript extensible/chromium compatible?
2017-10-24 17:54:08	dougsmith	s/chromium/plugin/
2017-10-24 17:54:39	8bit	hmmm
2017-10-24 17:54:39	8bit	I'm not sure.
2017-10-24 17:54:54	8bit	I think qutebrowser?? Idk.  I know it's very easy to customize, though.
2017-10-24 17:55:37	ccarball	If anyone is free wednesday/friday 9:25am-10:15am, I am looking for a temporary databases partner-in-crime replacement while jcioffi is in texas
2017-10-24 17:57:06	dougsmith	THERE'S A SEAT OPEN IN DATABASES!!!!!!?

2017-12-03 23:09:31	ccarball	hi friends! so friday was the planned day for gift exchange. Is everyone still free? We can do a cute little get together to exchange the gifts, maybe order some pizza, watch a christmas movie with hott cocoa (or like we could just all sit down for ten minutes to give away gifts and go our separate ways if thats what you all would prefer)
2017-12-03 23:09:40	ccarball	(crtl-x saves the day)
2017-12-03 23:10:28	dougsmith	I have one meeting that I still have to get a time for, and one house to visit, but defs free all evening

2017-12-05 14:08:23	ccarball	dougsmith: really? not even 'the year without a santa clause' or any of the rudolf ones or 'santa clause is coming to town'???

2017-12-06 13:37:39	dougsmith	Hey guys, the reason I was cryptically asking about Thursday. But the New Orleans Brass Band is performing at 10:00PM in Reckers and it is easily the coolest thing that's happening in the next two weeks. Not saying anyone has to go, but it's where I'll be Thursday night.
2017-12-06 13:40:49	ccarball	If I'm not sleeping I'll go with you
2017-12-06 15:25:32	dougsmith	@[everyone who's here next year] if you're looking for projects to work on next summer, app club just sent me an email about a project that's looking for a manager next year. I don't have any details about the project, but the meeting is at 8PM tonight if anyone wants to check it out.
2017-12-06 15:26:14	dougsmith	tldr; management position is yours if you can come to a meeting tonight.

2017-12-08 14:33:28	dougsmith	I don't remember a time, but it would be cool to get things exchanged before AKK arrives, and then do Christmas hang-out things.
