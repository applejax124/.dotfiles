2017-12-09 10:02:53	wtheisen	@ewilli23 I️ve got a good friend at EA if you want to talk to someone
2017-12-09 10:04:26	wtheisen	pbui we can do better than those examples!
2017-12-09 10:07:13	bdevorem	My labmate's research made it on hacker news
2017-12-09 10:07:16	bdevorem	https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15882858 
2017-12-09 10:07:27	bdevorem	Apparently at 7am it was on the front page
2017-12-09 10:13:42	walter.scheirer	neat
2017-12-09 11:07:50	pbui	https://danluu.com/anon-benchmark/ 
2017-12-09 11:08:11	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-09 11:09:21	pbui	@bdevorem: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~popl-interviews/index.html 
2017-12-09 11:09:26	walter.scheirer	"Anonymous assassination markets appear to be a joke, but how about anonymous markets for benchmarks?"
2017-12-09 11:09:26	pbui	when will u be on this list of people
2017-12-09 11:09:38	walter.scheirer	i've always wondered why this never really materialized
2017-12-09 11:09:42	walter.scheirer	especially in the era of leaks
2017-12-09 11:12:11	pbui	im surprised this is enforcable
2017-12-09 11:12:17	pbui	well not surprised, but more annoyed
2017-12-09 11:12:27	pbui	u cant benchmark something u paid for?
2017-12-09 11:12:29	pbui	wtf
2017-12-09 11:12:38	pbui	or i guess, u cant publish it
2017-12-09 11:15:10	walter.scheirer	this is widespread in commercial software
2017-12-09 11:15:20	walter.scheirer	i see this kind of clause all of the time in biometrics software
2017-12-09 11:15:41	pbui	i dont use commercial software, so i havent been exposed to this bizarre world
2017-12-09 11:15:46	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-09 11:37:52	wtheisen	so compilers was great, but where do I️ go after that?
2017-12-09 11:39:36	wtheisen	embedded devices? or reverse engineering?
2017-12-09 11:55:57	pbui	algorithms
2017-12-09 12:01:22	wtheisen	REEEEEEEE no please god
2017-12-09 12:06:59	wtheisen	I need something a bit easier than that
2017-12-09 12:07:35	walter.scheirer	to me, reverse engineering is a lot more difficult that algorithms
2017-12-09 12:07:46	walter.scheirer	given the complexity of today's codebases
2017-12-09 12:08:20	wtheisen	I just really liked playing around with the assembly in compilers
2017-12-09 12:08:40	wtheisen	It finally felt like coding was fun and challenging again
2017-12-09 12:09:24	walter.scheirer	@wtheisen: take a look at GPUs
2017-12-09 12:09:49	wtheisen	in what context?
2017-12-09 12:10:58	walter.scheirer	a logical extension of what you just learned in compilers
2017-12-09 12:11:04	walter.scheirer	but different arch.
2017-12-09 12:11:23	wtheisen	Nice, I'll definitely do that then
2017-12-09 12:11:39	walter.scheirer	code acceleration with GPUs is a growing area
2017-12-09 12:11:44	walter.scheirer	for general purpose problems
2017-12-09 12:12:29	wtheisen	So would that be like "how do I separate this problem into a set that allows me to fully utilize all these cores on the GPU" ?
2017-12-09 12:13:13	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-12-09 12:14:19	pbui	that's what i did for my masters
2017-12-09 12:14:21	pbui	GPGPU
2017-12-09 12:14:28	walter.scheirer	there you go
2017-12-09 12:14:35	walter.scheirer	following in the footsteps of @pbui
2017-12-09 12:14:39	pbui	cuda 1.0
2017-12-09 12:14:41	pbui	good times
2017-12-09 12:14:43	walter.scheirer	wow
2017-12-09 12:14:58	walter.scheirer	cuda is still relatively primitive
2017-12-09 12:15:02	walter.scheirer	remarkably
2017-12-09 12:15:03	pbui	we were jsut transitioning from using opengl shaders to to cuda
2017-12-09 12:15:11	walter.scheirer	there are many optimizations for many problems that are not baked into the library
2017-12-09 12:16:22	pbui	wtheisen: there has been some interesting work on creating compilers for different languages that target GPUs
2017-12-09 12:16:42	pbui	b/c the GPU has a very different execution model, perhaps a new language paradigm is needed
2017-12-09 12:17:00	pbui	if u are considering ND for grad school, u might want to talk to kogge or brockman about this
2017-12-09 12:17:15	pbui	b/c they are interested in compilers for their fancy arch
2017-12-09 12:18:29	walter.scheirer	aren't they kind of distracted these days with their company?
2017-12-09 12:18:42	pbui	http://www.emutechnology.com/ 
2017-12-09 12:18:48	pbui	probably
2017-12-09 12:39:13	bdevorem	omg i was just invited to emery's surprise 50th bday party
2017-12-09 12:39:24	ewilli23	Is there any analog of python generators in C/C++?
2017-12-09 12:42:08	pbui	Iterators can be used to build generators I think
2017-12-09 12:42:15	pbui	Not a common practice
2017-12-09 12:44:13	pbui	https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9059187/equivalent-c-to-python-generator-pattern#9060689 
2017-12-09 12:48:32	ewilli23	I was just thinking a generator would be useful for the OS project to be able to write a function to load an inode without having to re-read the block every time (if you’re iterating through all the inodes, say)
2017-12-09 12:54:15	pbui	yeah, it would
2017-12-09 13:22:22	dchiang	Might be able to fake it with setjmp/longjmp
2017-12-09 13:23:18	dchiang	http://fanf.livejournal.com/105413.html 
2017-12-09 18:26:10	wtheisen	So I don't have access to my unofficial transcripts for the schools I used to attend, but ND only asks for the unofficial ones, wat do?
2017-12-09 18:33:54	walter.scheirer	you can send us anything
2017-12-09 18:33:58	walter.scheirer	it's fine...
2017-12-09 18:34:56	wtheisen	Okay, so it's not a problem if I send the official ones?
2017-12-09 18:35:02	walter.scheirer	no problem at all
2017-12-09 18:35:14	walter.scheirer	i think the unofficial guideline is meant to make your life easier
2017-12-09 18:36:56	wtheisen	Yeah I figured. So do I just upload something that says, transcript sent officially so the web interface doesn't complain at me?
2017-12-09 18:37:13	walter.scheirer	sure
2017-12-09 18:38:46	wtheisen	sweet, thanks @walter.scheirer
2017-12-09 18:46:15	jcioffi	unofficial transcript you can just pull from insideND @wtheisen
2017-12-09 18:46:37	wtheisen	I have my ND one, just not one from the other two schools
2017-12-09 18:46:46	jcioffi	oh sorry misread
2017-12-09 18:47:06	jcioffi	did you transfer or something?
2017-12-09 18:47:19	jcioffi	_is confused_
2017-12-09 18:48:04	wtheisen	No but in highschool I took a bunch of college classes, then I took one over the summer freshman year
2017-12-09 18:48:16	wtheisen	and all the gradschools want ALL of the transcripts
2017-12-09 18:48:20	wtheisen	which is really annoying
2017-12-09 20:47:44	androidkitkat	whats the proper way to ask for an extension on an assignment
2017-12-09 21:00:49	jbaker10	Ask and give email
2017-12-09 21:47:50	androidkitkat	that simple?
2017-12-09 21:47:57	androidkitkat	ill do that
2017-12-09 22:03:47	pbui	androidkitkat: sacrifice a child process
2017-12-09 22:12:00	jcioffi	@wtheisen I did something similar. I guess that means I took classes at a total of 4 undergraduate universities. notre Dame wouldn't count any of them though
2017-12-09 22:12:49	androidkitkat	@pbui that was painless
2017-12-09 22:22:25	bdevorem	@wtheisen i took community college classes in high school and i just didnt include them in my grad apps.
2017-12-09 22:23:33	bdevorem	seemed irrelevant to graduate studies in PL
2017-12-09 22:23:48	bdevorem	@wtheisen u applying to umass
2017-12-09 22:23:49	bdevorem	?
2017-12-09 22:23:57	bdevorem	@jcioffi you applying to grad school?
2017-12-09 22:24:11	bdevorem	@jbaker10 _you_ applying to umass?
2017-12-09 22:36:20	bdevorem	ugh who is too busy on a saturday night to talk to me, rude!
2017-12-09 22:37:38	catvajiac	bdevorem: hi i'm not too busy
2017-12-09 22:37:47	catvajiac	unless you count failing to understand comp arch as too busy
2017-12-09 22:38:07	pbui	@bdevorem: o/
2017-12-09 22:38:10	jeffrey	I say we make Ajit Pai watch the Who Shot Mr. Burns episode.
2017-12-09 22:38:24	pbui	jeffrey: he'd just spoof that too
2017-12-09 22:39:16	jeffrey	"Here is a business man doing something against the people's will at a town hall. Notice that when he leaves he gets shot and the entire town has a motive, and then they don't even arrest who did it"
2017-12-09 22:43:42	pbui	what do u mean against the people's will?
2017-12-09 22:43:48	pbui	all those comments were fake
2017-12-09 22:44:02	pbui	also we need to look at the quality of the comments, not just the quantity
2017-12-09 22:46:34	jeffrey	Yes, we do need to look at the comments
2017-12-09 22:46:50	jeffrey	So investigate the mass botting
2017-12-09 22:47:15	pbui	u know the internet wasnt broken in 2014
2017-12-09 22:47:26	pbui	this is just typical government overreach
2017-12-09 22:47:36	pbui	do u want obama telling u want u can have on the internet?
2017-12-09 22:47:39	pbui	that's censorship
2017-12-09 22:47:56	pbui	just let the free market give us the best quality servic
2017-12-09 22:48:09	pbui	innovation is being held back by over regulation
2017-12-09 22:50:28	jeffrey	Yes, free market. So why can't I run my own fiber lines, or broadcast my own nationwide chain of access points?
2017-12-09 22:50:40	jeffrey	Also
2017-12-09 22:50:59	jeffrey	@jeffrey uploaded a file: 3b70613.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0L54J0MD/F8CAP2HQS/3b70613.jpg 
2017-12-09 22:51:42	pbui	if only that would work
2017-12-09 23:03:17	androidkitkat	Asking for an extension worked
2017-12-09 23:03:19	androidkitkat	got until friday
2017-12-09 23:03:55	jeffrey	"https://southbend.craigslist.org/sop/d/apple-studio-display-monitor/6400712509.html "
2017-12-09 23:04:05	jeffrey	"Flat screen display"
2017-12-09 23:05:30	jeffrey	That is a CRT. There is nothing remotely flat panel about it.
2017-12-09 23:05:59	jeffrey	That said CRTs that big are getting hard to find
2017-12-09 23:12:19	androidkitkat	we had a 50' CRT at home for the longest time
2017-12-09 23:12:24	androidkitkat	it even had HDMI
2017-12-09 23:13:26	jeffrey	Fifty footer, wow
2017-12-09 23:13:29	jeffrey	Wait HDMI
2017-12-09 23:13:31	jeffrey	How
2017-12-09 23:13:33	jeffrey	What
2017-12-09 23:16:47	pbui	U sure it wasn't a dlp?
2017-12-09 23:16:57	pbui	I had one of those in grad school
2017-12-09 23:26:54	androidkitkat	@jeffrey it was huge
2017-12-09 23:26:58	androidkitkat	weighed a tonne
2017-12-09 23:27:08	androidkitkat	needed like 4 people to carry
2017-12-09 23:29:35	androidkitkat	ok so it was 36
2017-12-09 23:29:41	androidkitkat	a little overexageration
2017-12-09 23:29:41	androidkitkat	but
2017-12-09 23:29:44	androidkitkat	still
2017-12-09 23:30:03	androidkitkat	had HDMI
2017-12-09 23:30:04	androidkitkat	10/10
2017-12-10 03:17:08	jbaker10	@bdevorem looked into it. How many Theory people?
2017-12-10 08:41:42	pbui	Comcast is injecting 400+ lines of JavaScript into web pages - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15890551 
2017-12-10 09:45:24	mflanag6	o no
2017-12-10 09:45:54	walter.scheirer	that hasn't happened to me
2017-12-10 12:34:16	bdevorem	Hi @catvajiac
2017-12-10 12:34:42	bdevorem	@jbaker10 we have a good theory department
2017-12-10 13:13:09	catvajiac	bdevorem: how's grad school?
2017-12-10 14:43:22	walter.scheirer	wow, comcast is awfully slow today at the foundry
2017-12-10 14:43:27	walter.scheirer	i had to resort to eduroam
2017-12-10 14:44:10	androidkitkat	just route all your traffic thru DNS
2017-12-10 14:44:16	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-10 14:44:23	androidkitkat	it works
2017-12-10 14:44:27	androidkitkat	technically
2017-12-10 14:44:37	walter.scheirer	not sure how that will help my speed problem, but...
2017-12-10 14:44:45	walter.scheirer	eduroam is working quite well
2017-12-10 14:44:48	androidkitkat	thats a first
2017-12-10 14:44:50	walter.scheirer	maybe i will cancel comcast
2017-12-10 14:44:59	androidkitkat	i would
2017-12-10 14:45:21	pbui	Pringles cans
2017-12-10 14:45:32	androidkitkat	we were on CenturyTel at home for a bit
2017-12-10 14:45:42	androidkitkat	but they refuse to give speeds faster than 10 Mb/s
2017-12-10 14:47:16	androidkitkat	@pbui why not just mail everything at that point
2017-12-10 14:57:22	walter.scheirer	nah, effective antenna
2017-12-10 14:57:40	walter.scheirer	i used many a pringles can in the early days of wifi
2017-12-10 14:58:10	walter.scheirer	then my college house got a yagi
2017-12-10 14:58:21	androidkitkat	omg really
2017-12-10 14:58:29	walter.scheirer	and we could pull reliable wireless from the university from blocks away
2017-12-10 14:58:31	androidkitkat	thought he meant can and string
2017-12-10 14:58:38	androidkitkat	this is news
2017-12-10 14:58:53	androidkitkat	also i like an idiot opened something in vim as read only and typed like 50 lines
2017-12-10 14:59:03	androidkitkat	do i have to start over
2017-12-10 15:01:29	8bit	I think you can save it as another file and then move it
2017-12-10 15:01:37	8bit	gimme a sec, just don't close it
2017-12-10 15:01:47	androidkitkat	that makes sense
2017-12-10 15:02:04	androidkitkat	dont know how to do that but i havent closed it yet
2017-12-10 15:02:23	walter.scheirer	:w file
2017-12-10 15:02:34	pbui	:w /tmp/new.file
2017-12-10 15:02:38	androidkitkat	ty
2017-12-10 15:02:47	androidkitkat	just learned something new
2017-12-10 15:02:54	androidkitkat	prob should have known that
2017-12-10 15:03:08	catvajiac	i always accidentally do that with '
2017-12-10 15:03:14	catvajiac	b/c it's right next to :
2017-12-10 15:03:26	androidkitkat	just remap ' to :
2017-12-10 15:03:40	androidkitkat	problem solved temporarily
2017-12-10 15:03:41	pbui	chmod 420 blaze.it 
2017-12-10 15:03:50	androidkitkat	chmod 400 any file you want to not see again
2017-12-10 15:04:14	catvajiac	pbui: you have to wait another hour or so
2017-12-10 15:04:29	8bit	catvajiac: please don't remind me I wasted most of today
2017-12-10 15:04:35	catvajiac	same
2017-12-10 15:04:38	catvajiac	oops
2017-12-10 15:05:18	pbui	What's great is when u have perms to remove a fine but canr
2017-12-10 15:05:23	pbui	Can't*
2017-12-10 15:05:32	pbui	Bc of extended attributes
2017-12-10 15:05:43	pbui	So u have to do chattr
2017-12-10 15:05:51	androidkitkat	windows sometimes just straight up removes your admin permissions sometimes
2017-12-10 15:05:59	pbui	But no one ever remembers those
2017-12-10 15:06:13	androidkitkat	!g chattr
2017-12-10 15:06:14	bobbit	@androidkitkat: https://yld.me/z7g 
2017-12-10 15:07:48	pbui	Chattr +i make things immutable
2017-12-10 15:08:11	8bit	`$ man lsattr`  => "Bugs: There are none :-)"  lol
2017-12-10 15:08:27	8bit	Can you not chattr -i afterwards?
2017-12-10 15:08:57	androidkitkat	attrib +S C:\Windows /D
2017-12-10 15:10:16	androidkitkat	attrib +R C:\autoexec.bat
2017-12-10 15:33:09	pbui	Yeah u can change the attribute afterwards
2017-12-10 17:37:03	jbaker10	anyone know Algol 60?
2017-12-10 18:09:11	pbui	@pbui uploaded a file: IMG_20171210_180801602.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0HK21CP2/F8CK3ERD3/img_20171210_180801602.jpg  and commented: Lug Christmas gift
2017-12-10 18:16:50	dchiang	Why do you want to know Algol 60??
2017-12-10 18:17:12	dchiang	I wish I could say I knew it -- very significant language
2017-12-10 18:17:35	dchiang	Pseudocode is based on Algol so it should look very familiar
2017-12-10 18:25:05	jbaker10	The book you gave me on Denotational Semantics uses it. That book is actually really really good. I'm reading the whole thing. read about 1/3 last night
2017-12-10 18:26:54	dchiang	Oh good
2017-12-10 18:27:45	jbaker10	I'm not entirely sure how to write a tutorial on it though
2017-12-10 18:27:47	jbaker10	oh well
2017-12-10 18:31:28	flynn	makes mental note to offer a HoPL course some day (History of Programming Languages)
2017-12-10 18:32:21	wtheisen	add embedded devices, hobby electronics, and cracking/reverse engineering to that list
2017-12-10 18:33:26	flynn	Yep all of that too

2017-12-10 18:37:16	flynn	so many topics could easily be their own course. Some obscure, some extremely relevant and current
2017-12-10 19:31:39	bdevorem	@catvajiac tis good. how's ND?
2017-12-10 19:33:27	catvajiac	pretty good, i'm hanging in there for finals week
2017-12-10 20:31:06	wtheisen	what's a three address RISC architecture mean?
2017-12-10 20:33:00	alitteke	I think when you use an assembly language it's the maximum number of register that are used in any one instruction
2017-12-10 20:33:00	alitteke	x86 is two (maybe?) because you have /
2017-12-10 20:33:12	alitteke	Add r1 r2
2017-12-10 20:33:29	alitteke	but ARM is three because you have```ADD R1 R2 R3```
2017-12-10 20:34:51	wtheisen	But what about the fancy ones for array access with like 3 or 4 registers?
2017-12-10 20:34:54	wtheisen	in x86
2017-12-10 20:37:31	alitteke	That's still one address
2017-12-10 20:38:20	alitteke	The calculation may involve more, but the instruction itself is only dealing with two addresses
2017-12-10 20:45:47	jeffrey	That's a different address mode @wtheisen
2017-12-10 20:46:11	jeffrey	I interpreted it the same way as @alitteke
2017-12-10 20:46:30	wtheisen	Yeah apparently ARM and MIPS are 3-RISC
2017-12-10 20:47:23	jbaker10	mips 4 lyfe
2017-12-10 20:47:35	jeffrey	I feel we covered a different set of things than that final though
2017-12-10 20:48:15	wtheisen	I mean that's the only questions that had things I didn't immediately recognize on it
2017-12-10 20:52:44	jeffrey	I guess I mean for 5 we covered conservative gc for like 7 minutes, and for 3 we never coded any optimizations
2017-12-10 20:58:08	wtheisen	Yeah but if you're familiar with the code, I don't think building an optimizer for a specific sub-case is *TOO* tricky
2017-12-10 20:59:18	jeffrey	I wonder how specific that one should be. What if they multiplication is swapped?
2017-12-10 20:59:44	jeffrey	Also, for a "highly optimized compiler" is it trying to use as few registers as possible, or the opposite?
2017-12-10 20:59:44	wtheisen	Yeah we were wondering how much we could assume as well
2017-12-10 21:00:00	jeffrey	Be as fast as possivle
2017-12-10 21:00:02	wtheisen	I got it down to 4 registers, I'm pretty sure that's the min
2017-12-10 21:00:20	wtheisen	well it says "Clearly state the minimum number of registers needed"
2017-12-10 21:00:36	jeffrey	Right, but it doesn't say "use the minimum"
2017-12-10 21:01:01	jeffrey	I also figure we're supposed to do that dependency graph for the minimum number
2017-12-10 21:01:25	wtheisen	Yeah it wasn't very clear there either
2017-12-10 21:01:44	jeffrey	I do not want a question like that
2017-12-10 21:01:57	jeffrey	Mixing in IRs
2017-12-10 21:02:05	wtheisen	I'd much prefer that over a follow table
2017-12-10 21:02:37	jeffrey	But I don't wanna convert it to SSA
2017-12-10 21:02:43	jeffrey	And maybe a stack
2017-12-10 21:04:50	wtheisen	ewww yeah I just noticed the last line stating they were arguments
2017-12-10 21:05:10	wtheisen	:no_good: no managing the stack pls
2017-12-10 21:10:42	jeffrey	That's the "lower the average by 20 points" question
2017-12-10 21:11:35	wtheisen	On a ten point question lol
2017-12-10 21:11:44	wtheisen	That's how hard it is
2017-12-10 21:18:02	jeffrey	He said something about things being "open ended" right?
2017-12-10 21:18:21	jeffrey	So maybe as long as you have a clue for that type of question you won't die
2017-12-10 21:19:30	jeffrey	I figure we will have a "make this grammar LL(1) and write a recursive descent parser" question for it
2017-12-10 21:22:03	wtheisen	Algs is the final I'm truly worried about
2017-12-10 21:22:54	jeffrey	I'm more worried for compilers. Mostly because I get 3 days for algs, which should be good.
2017-12-10 23:15:17	jeffrey	I'm most worried for grad apps
2017-12-10 23:20:52	bdevorem	Compilers final was quite fair last year for everyone who is wondering.
2017-12-10 23:21:17	bdevorem	Know how to generate code and typecheck.
2017-12-10 23:21:21	bdevorem	Know assembly.
2017-12-10 23:31:11	wtheisen	@jeffrey yeah I feel, I'm definitely limping across the line for applications
2017-12-10 23:47:32	wtheisen	@walter.scheirer have you read the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Sikorski and Honig?
2017-12-10 23:47:39	wtheisen	if so can you recommend?
2017-12-11 01:31:38	jeffrey	I totally forgot to do CIFs
2017-12-11 01:32:50	jeffrey	Now I gotta wait till Christmas for grades
2017-12-11 07:30:45	walter.scheirer	@wtheisen: i have not...
2017-12-11 10:11:18	androidkitkat	@silv3r do you know where the calc 3 exam is
2017-12-11 10:17:43	silv3r	Not sure
2017-12-11 10:18:19	silv3r	Oh gosh
2017-12-11 10:18:39	silv3r	It’s at Stepan Center @androidkitkat
2017-12-11 10:18:55	silv3r	Tomorrow
2017-12-11 10:19:05	androidkitkat	o boi
2017-12-11 10:19:22	silv3r	Make sure to wear layers. It will either be very very hot or very very cold
2017-12-11 10:19:37	silv3r	I can’t remember if the heat works very well in there
2017-12-11 10:19:49	silv3r	Also how well do you know calc
2017-12-11 10:19:59	silv3r	I’m lost
2017-12-11 10:34:04	silv3r	Hmu if u want to study today
2017-12-11 11:02:32	wtheisen	calc three was unpleasant
2017-12-11 11:04:33	silv3r	RT
2017-12-11 11:04:58	wtheisen	Don't worry linear is far far worse :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-12-11 11:06:32	a3qz	I preferred 3 to 2
2017-12-11 11:06:49	silv3r	I also like how they leave out any explanations on the answer keys
2017-12-11 11:06:55	a3qz	which is such a low compliment that its basically not one
2017-12-11 11:06:57	silv3r	:upside_down_face:
2017-12-11 11:28:33	ewilli23	“The proof is left as an exercise to the student”

2017-12-11 12:08:31	androidkitkat	@silv3r i did an item analysis
2017-12-11 12:08:37	androidkitkat	want me to send it to you
2017-12-11 12:14:48	silv3r	I am shook
2017-12-11 12:14:50	silv3r	Thanks
2017-12-11 12:19:01	androidkitkat	sorry for the weird #ing
2017-12-11 12:19:12	androidkitkat	but test 1 and test 4 are the ones they gave us
2017-12-11 12:19:25	androidkitkat	and it seems that those are really similar
2017-12-11 12:19:33	androidkitkat	so either theyre trolling us
2017-12-11 12:19:42	androidkitkat	or its going to be like final
2017-12-11 12:20:37	silv3r	:3
2017-12-11 12:21:10	wtheisen	usually the practice tests are pretty accurate for math
2017-12-11 14:11:08	androidkitkat	who wants to fill out a good old fashioned google form
2017-12-11 14:11:09	androidkitkat	https://goo.gl/forms/RqzxNZ6TQ69IzRVk2 
2017-12-11 14:11:18	androidkitkat	ignore the typos
2017-12-11 14:17:19	androidkitkat	Who selected MorphOS
2017-12-11 14:17:26	androidkitkat	No one uses MorphOS
2017-12-11 14:17:29	jeffrey	My calc2 final apparently WAS the practice test
2017-12-11 14:17:52	wtheisen	I remember there were 5 questions exactly the same on the calc 2 final
2017-12-11 14:18:00	androidkitkat	two people put ur mom
2017-12-11 14:19:46	jeffrey	You know, ur mom linux, the distro with automatic garbage collection and organization of old files that automatically renames every game to "nintendo" and adds pause buttons to multiplayer games.
2017-12-11 14:20:51	androidkitkat	No one has chosen System 7
2017-12-11 14:21:45	androidkitkat	which if anything, is the best
2017-12-11 14:25:51	jeffrey	"Gigabyte 980 TI
2017-12-11 14:25:51	jeffrey	High-end gaming GPU. Capable of running games at their highest settings" South Bend Craigslist, why must you lie.
2017-12-11 14:26:48	androidkitkat	a 980 Ti is no slouch tho
2017-12-11 14:27:17	jeffrey	I'm not saying it is, but it is roughly a 1070. If someone buys it for 1440p or 4k, they will be disappointed.
2017-12-11 14:29:34	jeffrey	I just want the local Craigslist to be precise and honest
2017-12-11 14:32:09	androidkitkat	call the police on him
2017-12-11 14:33:20	androidkitkat	that will teach him
2017-12-11 14:33:31	jeffrey	He's not as bad as some people. I saw someone selling a gtx 750 ti for $200.
2017-12-11 14:34:16	androidkitkat	thats about a $100 markup
2017-12-11 14:34:37	jeffrey	"Plays all games at high settings"
2017-12-11 14:34:59	androidkitkat	sets PUBG to high
2017-12-11 14:35:14	jeffrey	You need the GTX 2080 for that
2017-12-11 14:35:35	androidkitkat	its been getting more optimized
2017-12-11 14:35:48	androidkitkat	Nvidia says  a 1080 Ti can run it high @ 4k
2017-12-11 14:36:30	jeffrey	It should not be a $30 right now
2017-12-11 14:36:38	jeffrey	I mean, from a value perspective
2017-12-11 14:36:49	androidkitkat	i mean ive put over 200 hours since the summer
2017-12-11 14:36:51	jeffrey	It sold well enough that it was a good price
2017-12-11 14:36:57	androidkitkat	its coming to xbox
2017-12-11 14:37:00	androidkitkat	so
2017-12-11 14:37:10	androidkitkat	its probably getting some optimzations
2017-12-11 14:37:30	jeffrey	What if they just shrink the map
2017-12-11 14:37:40	androidkitkat	xbox plays with pc iirc
2017-12-11 14:37:47	jeffrey	What? No way
2017-12-11 14:37:53	jeffrey	A mouse is a HUGE advantage
2017-12-11 14:37:54	androidkitkat	i could be wrong
2017-12-11 14:37:56	androidkitkat	ik
2017-12-11 14:38:41	jeffrey	My opinion though is $30 puts it at like the top 3% most expensive steam games
2017-12-11 14:39:57	jeffrey	I usually follow a $1/hr upper bound, and don't see myself putting in 30 hours.
2017-12-11 14:41:43	androidkitkat	its a fun game
2017-12-11 14:41:46	androidkitkat	i enjoy the BR
2017-12-11 14:42:05	androidkitkat	they do the genre better than Fortnite
2017-12-11 14:50:48	jeffrey	Fortnite was a different game with BR slapped on
2017-12-11 14:51:29	jeffrey	That said I enjoy Fortnite. It runs well and is free, but having played both PUBG is definitely the better game.
2017-12-11 14:51:46	androidkitkat	the free part of it is the seller
2017-12-11 14:51:48	androidkitkat	or
2017-12-11 14:51:53	androidkitkat	not seller?
2017-12-11 14:52:58	jeffrey	I'm not a fan of long range gameplay though. When I'm home and play pubg on a laptop at 720p I am at such a disadvantage since everyone is a blur
2017-12-11 14:54:02	androidkitkat	fun fact: the only solo pubg games ive won were on a dual core mobile i7 and a gtx 820m
2017-12-11 14:54:29	jeffrey	I came in second in a trio game. Then killed my teammates.
2017-12-11 14:54:58	jeffrey	Or rather, was in a firefight with the only other team, and grenaded my two teammates.
2017-12-11 14:55:05	androidkitkat	oh lol
2017-12-11 14:55:16	androidkitkat	i enjoy solo games
2017-12-11 14:55:26	androidkitkat	squads with 3 other real friends is fun
2017-12-11 14:55:37	androidkitkat	bc we can discord and troll in all chat
2017-12-11 14:55:45	walter.scheirer	yay, i now have functional ethernet jacks in my office
2017-12-11 14:55:49	walter.scheirer	goodbye eduroam
2017-12-11 14:55:56	androidkitkat	rip eduroam
2017-12-11 14:56:24	jeffrey	The internet ruined online gaming
2017-12-11 14:56:53	pbui	now that walter.scheirer is no longer bogarting the wifis, maybe it will work
2017-12-11 14:56:58	jeffrey	I'm glad games are finally splitting solo from squads though
2017-12-11 14:57:00	walter.scheirer	ha
2017-12-11 14:57:17	walter.scheirer	this is like night and day
2017-12-11 14:57:25	walter.scheirer	in terms of connectivity
2017-12-11 14:57:43	jeffrey	@pbui I've been using pingfs, might that slow down the network?
2017-12-11 14:58:02	pbui	possibly
2017-12-11 14:59:43	jeffrey	If I run it, will the FBI be like "why are you DOSing google?" And I'll be like "I'm just saving my grad apps..."
2017-12-11 15:00:19	jeffrey	Also ND urged me to consider their student life and proximity to Chicago.
2017-12-11 15:01:03	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-11 15:01:05	jeffrey	I wonder if I can convince them to fly me in for a visit, but just use my return ticket to go home for Spring Break.
2017-12-11 15:02:48	pbui	https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/12/apple-has-acquired-shazam/ 
2017-12-11 15:32:48	flynn	@flynn uploaded a file: Wang03-shazam.pdf https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U3VAZJ9L6/F8CAYD4SU/wang03-shazam.pdf  and commented: The technical idea behind Shazam (at time of launch, anyway) was documented in a wonderfully accessible paper. Summary: constellation matching in the spectrogram.
2017-12-11 15:54:56	jeffrey	@wtheisen @alitteke where is the compilers exam
2017-12-11 15:56:20	alitteke	125 Debart
2017-12-11 15:56:29	alitteke	Tomorrow though
2017-12-11 15:56:53	jeffrey	Yeah
2017-12-11 15:56:59	jeffrey	Thanks
2017-12-11 16:01:06	wtheisen	It's gonna be lit
2017-12-11 16:07:29	jeffrey	I'm terrified
2017-12-11 16:17:15	wtheisen	we're pre-gaming right?
2017-12-11 16:17:41	8bit	yep, you are, tell me how that goes
2017-12-11 16:18:07	wtheisen	balmer peak bb
2017-12-11 16:19:52	8bit	don't overshoot bb
2017-12-11 16:23:41	jeffrey	I mean, I took shots while studying data structures...
2017-12-11 16:24:26	jeffrey	I also practiced the GRE after a drink and a half and did better than I did on the real test
2017-12-11 16:57:51	jeffrey	For `FADD %r1, %r3 -> %r4 live: %r2 %r3 %r4`, why is %r2 live but not %r1?

2017-12-11 17:05:21	jbaker10	:P
2017-12-11 17:05:49	jeffrey	should it be 1?
2017-12-11 17:17:53		[ccarball back: gone 00:00:09]
2017-12-11 17:56:29	alitteke	I think so
2017-12-11 17:56:37	alitteke	I doesn't really make sense otherwise?

2017-12-11 21:05:25	ncarroll	thats why you do exams in pen

2017-12-11 21:07:01	pbui	oh wait
2017-12-11 21:07:08	silv3r	Oh wait
2017-12-11 21:07:22	pbui	put in place
2017-12-11 21:07:41	silv3r	That would be me if I remembered that argc = 1 if nothing is passed into the command line
2017-12-11 21:07:42	jeffrey	@pbui prove the problem of finding spiders in a bed is NP-Hard.
2017-12-11 21:07:52	silv3r	I think I’m still fine tho ;)
2017-12-11 21:08:44	jeffrey	In the best of operating systems argc=2 and there are always two arguments passed.
2017-12-11 21:09:01	jeffrey	And they are the program name and the word "run"

2017-12-11 23:11:35	jeffrey	I mean, what you downloaded from the app store is not just Linux, but GNU/Linux+NT-Linux, or as I've taken to calling it, GNU/NT.
2017-12-11 23:11:44	wtheisen	Oh no
2017-12-11 23:11:56	jeffrey	+Ubuntu
2017-12-11 23:11:58	wtheisen	hide your toenail food it's RMS
2017-12-11 23:12:01	ccarball	a wild cnailos appears!!!
2017-12-11 23:12:21	cnailos	sounds pretty complicated, I think I better just stick with windows 10. It has cortana after all
2017-12-11 23:12:26	dougsmith	cnailos: well, you're _using_ it... so yeah
2017-12-11 23:12:35	jcioffi	wow
2017-12-11 23:12:38	jcioffi	hi @cnailos
2017-12-11 23:12:51	wtheisen	I do like bash for windows tbh
2017-12-11 23:13:18	jeffrey	It's made even better after you install PowerShell on Bash on Ubuntu on Windows
2017-12-11 23:13:51	cnailos	^4D chess at its finest
2017-12-11 23:14:00	dougsmith	Seems needlessly recursive...
2017-12-11 23:14:20	8bit	i was gonna say, I got wine working on my distro so I could run vmware running my distro
2017-12-11 23:14:22	cnailos	hi jess. will u take my OS final? pbui is pbulli
2017-12-11 23:14:35	dougsmith	... Like me using a vm to ssh into a vm through a proxy running in my dorm room
2017-12-11 23:14:35	wtheisen	lol
2017-12-11 23:14:51	ccarball	cnailos: ill take it for ya
2017-12-11 23:15:06	dougsmith	cnailos: are you still on the campaign trail from the groupme?
2017-12-11 23:15:34	cnailos	crooked bui must be stopped at all costs. How else will we make Hagar great again?
2017-12-11 23:15:45	ccarball	Haggar*
2017-12-11 23:16:06	jeffrey	When the psych department leaves you drop the second g
2017-12-11 23:16:13	dougsmith	cnailos: Haggar has always been great
2017-12-11 23:16:15	cnailos	I prefer the alternative non-fake news spelling please and thanks
2017-12-11 23:16:16	jeffrey	It's a weird grammar rule I know, but it's proper
2017-12-11 23:16:21	8bit	cnailos: just remember that everything is a lie
2017-12-11 23:16:27	jcioffi	@cnailos youdont want me taking that for ya
2017-12-11 23:16:29	dougsmith	It's getting greater b/c we work there
2017-12-11 23:16:43	ccarball	cnailos: like i said, ill take the os final for you
2017-12-11 23:16:46	cnailos	well ya know I mean yeah i figured but hey dell still hired you so...
2017-12-11 23:16:47	ccarball	i really want to take it
2017-12-11 23:16:53	jcioffi	rude
2017-12-11 23:17:06	jeffrey	@wtheisen @alitteke what about IR and GC are you guys focusing on?
2017-12-11 23:17:37	wtheisen	Not much focus on IR, for gc the names, methods, and the pros and cons
2017-12-11 23:18:02	alitteke	I'm doing the same for GC with just the different benefit each IR presents
2017-12-11 23:18:49	wtheisen	Did IRs really appear on the practice exams?
2017-12-11 23:19:14	alitteke	There was the one about register counting
2017-12-11 23:19:35	wtheisen	I mean you didn't have to know too much about IRs right?
2017-12-11 23:19:42	wtheisen	Just make up a psuedo-dag
2017-12-11 23:19:49	wtheisen	and you;d be fine
2017-12-11 23:20:27	jeffrey	For #4 it says "write out how it would be in any intermediary forms"
2017-12-11 23:20:46	alitteke	I thought it would be better in as a Linear IR
2017-12-11 23:21:11	wtheisen	I mean that would make mopre sense for the purpose of register tracking
2017-12-11 23:21:16	jeffrey	I tried LIR and SSA,
2017-12-11 23:21:25	wtheisen	I was just gonna solve the graph color problem
2017-12-11 23:21:33	wtheisen	Same diff
2017-12-11 23:21:35	jeffrey	A smart thing would combine all of the (a+b)s, but how do you do that
2017-12-11 23:21:56	jeffrey	Yeah but how do you find the dependencies for the coloring problem?
2017-12-11 23:22:45	wtheisen	I dunno just make something up, that's how I usually get through those sort of problems
2017-12-12 01:01:34	jbaker10	Just use compactness for coloring
2017-12-12 01:01:37	jbaker10	Btw
2017-12-12 09:11:11	pbui	https://www.servethehome.com/say-farewell-putty-microsoft-adds-openssh-client-windows-10/

2017-12-12 09:18:51	pbui	jeffrey: more smash bros
2017-12-12 09:21:14	jeffrey	Smash bros? The gamem

2017-12-12 09:29:55	jeffrey	I have 4 left, assuming I don't literally die during compilers there is no chance I don't submit grades tonight
2017-12-12 09:41:37	pbui	ok
2017-12-12 09:48:10	jeffrey	!!! Someone wrote "no dank memes" on my returned algs homework 7

2017-12-12 16:21:53	bdevorem	so umass does final exams starting wednesday and then ending next wednesday
2017-12-12 16:22:00	bdevorem	so like, there's a whole weekend in between
2017-12-12 16:22:08	walter.scheirer	wow, that's late
2017-12-12 16:22:23	bdevorem	we started a week after ND
2017-12-12 16:22:39	bdevorem	but like, they have a whole weekend break in between exams
2017-12-12 16:22:47	bdevorem	that's weird, right?
2017-12-12 16:35:12	jbaker10	I think a little bit yeah
2017-12-12 16:35:25	walter.scheirer	when i was in college i recall having a two-week final period
2017-12-12 16:36:31	bdevorem	I think I like this setup
2017-12-12 16:36:43	bdevorem	I don't have finals this semester so can't be entirely sure
2017-12-12 16:36:59	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-12 16:37:16	bdevorem	I do have a wacko final project but def better than exam
2017-12-12 16:40:44	jbaker10	what is it?
2017-12-12 16:43:56	bdevorem	basically rewrite (a subset of) javascript so that it doesn't ever lock up the browser
2017-12-12 16:44:15	bdevorem	if you're super interested: https://people.cs.umass.edu/~arjun/courses/compsci631-fall2017/hw/nonstopjs.pdf 
2017-12-12 16:44:28	bdevorem	using continuations
2017-12-12 16:50:02	jbaker10	oh continuations are the bane of my existence
2017-12-12 16:50:28	bdevorem	mix that with javascript and you get the worst of all worlds
2017-12-12 16:50:34	jbaker10	continuation passing style is grosssss
2017-12-12 16:50:46	bdevorem	again, mix that with javascript
2017-12-12 16:50:48	bdevorem	not pretty
2017-12-12 16:50:50	jbaker10	:stuck_out_tongue:
2017-12-12 16:50:55	jbaker10	i'm working on my project rn too
2017-12-12 16:50:58	jbaker10	but should be studying
2017-12-12 16:51:01	jbaker10	or grad appls
2017-12-12 16:51:08	bdevorem	woot woot
2017-12-12 16:51:16	bdevorem	killin it
2017-12-12 16:52:00	jbaker10	did you talk about denotational semantics?
2017-12-12 16:55:42	bdevorem	not explicitly, but we use it in every class
2017-12-12 16:56:03	jbaker10	thats my final project for PL
2017-12-12 16:56:15	bdevorem	doing what?
2017-12-12 17:09:34	jbaker10	Writing a basic intro to the idea of it. Using lattices and domains
2017-12-12 17:09:43	bdevorem	neat
2017-12-12 18:06:46	wtheisen	man that was wayyy suckier than I️ thought it would be
2017-12-12 18:09:03	jeffrey	It wasn't as bad as I was expecting, but definitely rougher than the midterm
2017-12-12 18:12:23	wtheisen	those first two, especially one made me very sad
2017-12-12 18:29:33	pbui	bdevorem: sounds like u are learning a lot at umass
2017-12-12 18:29:35	pbui	proud of u
2017-12-12 18:29:45	pbui	wtheisen: booty blast?
2017-12-12 18:29:58	jeffrey	Wtf
2017-12-12 18:34:26	jeffrey	Crud I forgot to pop %r10 and %r11

2017-12-12 18:36:18	jeffrey	Those poor people
2017-12-12 18:42:06	alitteke	I used the follow instead of the first for the table, because...
2017-12-12 18:42:07	alitteke	idk
2017-12-12 18:42:26	pbui	well, at least it is over with
2017-12-12 18:42:32	pbui	and u can start christmas
2017-12-12 18:51:50	wtheisen	definitely a booty-blast for me
2017-12-12 18:51:57	wtheisen	Those freaking grammars and tables
2017-12-12 18:52:03	wtheisen	ugh so theoretical
2017-12-12 18:52:39	pbui	3theoretical5me
2017-12-12 19:03:27	jeffrey	I would rather it have been "write a compiler for this simple calculator language"
2017-12-12 19:09:19	jeffrey	Hello strucr expr my old friend
2017-12-12 19:49:28	silv3r	1% below a grade cutoff for calc and physics
2017-12-12 19:49:57	silv3r	Does calc 3/physics 2 get curved at all :3
2017-12-12 19:50:45	androidkitkat	@silv3r is your final in?
2017-12-12 19:50:53	silv3r	Yeah
2017-12-12 19:50:58	androidkitkat	worries
2017-12-12 19:51:01	androidkitkat	mine isnt yet
2017-12-12 19:51:10	androidkitkat	under the exam section on sakai?
2017-12-12 19:51:14	silv3r	Probs cuz I turned it in late
2017-12-12 19:51:20	silv3r	I was there till the end
2017-12-12 19:51:26	silv3r	So I was on top of the pile
2017-12-12 19:51:29	silv3r	Yeah
2017-12-12 19:51:38	androidkitkat	i left 3 minutes early ish
2017-12-12 19:51:43	androidkitkat	more like 5
2017-12-12 19:51:44	androidkitkat	but
2017-12-12 19:51:50	androidkitkat	im so stressed
2017-12-12 19:52:34	silv3r	Is ok
2017-12-12 19:52:37	silv3r	:+1::skin-tone-4:
2017-12-12 20:01:36	pbui	I heard fund comp was brutal
2017-12-12 20:01:44	silv3r	Was it
2017-12-12 20:01:48	silv3r	Uhhhhh
2017-12-12 20:01:53	silv3r	:3
2017-12-12 20:02:06	silv3r	I forgot the whole argc argv thing but other than that
2017-12-12 20:02:10	silv3r	That makes me worried
2017-12-12 20:02:22	pbui	I heard recursion messed peeps up
2017-12-12 20:02:35	silv3r	I almost ffed it up
2017-12-12 20:02:45	silv3r	But I fixed it at the last second
2017-12-12 20:03:08	silv3r	Recursively adding a list
2017-12-12 20:03:23	pbui	We ll revisit argc and argv next semester
2017-12-12 20:03:54	silv3r	Should be like return list[i] + func(list, i-1) right
2017-12-12 20:04:35	pbui	Something like that
2017-12-12 20:04:43	silv3r	I had list [i-1] and returned at i == 0
2017-12-12 20:04:53	silv3r	Yay
2017-12-12 20:05:01	pbui	Did u have a base case?
2017-12-12 20:05:14	silv3r	Base was return at i==0
2017-12-12 20:05:20	pbui	Ok
2017-12-12 20:05:31	silv3r	Cuz in mine I actually had return list[i-1]
2017-12-12 20:05:38	silv3r	Since i begins as the list size
2017-12-12 21:16:13	walter.scheirer	wow, i'm spending $550 on Azure each month for just three instances
2017-12-12 21:25:04	androidkitkat	thats insane
2017-12-12 21:25:33	androidkitkat	just become a student again
2017-12-12 21:25:40	androidkitkat	and get "free" amazon web servies
2017-12-12 21:33:50	wmarkley	Does anyone know how to print a text file to a printer/pdf from bash?
2017-12-12 21:34:14	walter.scheirer	well, i'm not actually paying $550 in real money
2017-12-12 21:34:21	walter.scheirer	MSR gave me $20K in credits
2017-12-12 21:34:54	walter.scheirer	i'm more shocked at the amount of money such a simple setup burns through
2017-12-12 21:36:41	ewilli23	@wmarkley http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Printing-Usage-HOWTO-2.html 
2017-12-12 21:38:00	ewilli23	`lpr -p [printer] [filename]`
2017-12-12 21:38:19	wmarkley	Looks great. Thanks! @ewilli23
2017-12-13 07:28:03	jeffrey	There's a spider on my ceiling
2017-12-13 07:28:43	pbui	kill it w/ fire
2017-12-13 07:30:41	jeffrey	It's too high up
2017-12-13 07:36:11	jeffrey	It escaped
2017-12-13 08:22:16	8bit	anyone know if the huddle sells batteries?
2017-12-13 08:22:35	pbui	8bit: bookstore
2017-12-13 08:26:43	8bit	sad
2017-12-13 08:26:45	8bit	so far
2017-12-13 08:26:47	8bit	away
2017-12-13 08:35:27	jeffrey	The huddle definitely does
2017-12-13 08:59:04	walter.scheirer	those batteries are probably like $20 a piece at the huddle
2017-12-13 09:17:19	dchiang	What kind of batteries?
2017-12-13 09:17:34	dchiang	AA and 9 volts are free in DeBartolo
2017-12-13 09:18:23	8bit	My calculator takes AAA.
2017-12-13 09:29:44	androidkitkat	wait free double As/
2017-12-13 09:45:00	dchiang	yes, in the av office. just ask at the counter
2017-12-13 09:45:28	silv3r	Dang
2017-12-13 09:45:30	dchiang	after every lecture they toss two AAs into a recycling bin and if you ask, you can take as many as you want

2017-12-13 09:48:07	dchiang	but you can help by taking home free batteries
2017-12-13 10:03:07	androidkitkat	why would the battery only be used for 90 minutes?

2017-12-13 10:17:04	pbui	yeah, same
2017-12-13 10:17:38	walter.scheirer	last time I checked its uptime, it was nearing 1,000 days
2017-12-13 10:17:44	pbui	wow
2017-12-13 10:17:59	walter.scheirer	which means it hasn't rebooted since I plugged it in after moving in
2017-12-13 10:18:08	walter.scheirer	a trust testament to the stability of linux
2017-12-13 10:18:33	pbui	so u set it up when u moved and never power cycled it?
2017-12-13 10:18:39	walter.scheirer	correct
2017-12-13 10:18:49	walter.scheirer	it's not accessible from the internet
2017-12-13 10:18:52	pbui	i reboot mine regularly for kernel updates
2017-12-13 10:18:54	walter.scheirer	so no need to update
2017-12-13 10:19:02	pbui	all, mine is internet facing
2017-12-13 10:19:09	pbui	behind a router/firewall
2017-12-13 10:19:16	pbui	it's what i ssh into
2017-12-13 10:19:23	walter.scheirer	the only thing i want it to do is serve music
2017-12-13 10:19:25	walter.scheirer	and it does that just fine
2017-12-13 10:19:26	walter.scheirer	as is
2017-12-13 10:19:42	jeffrey	I want my music to be served over telephone
2017-12-13 10:20:08	walter.scheirer	backs away slowly
2017-12-13 10:20:29	jeffrey	That way I don't use 100MB of data on the bus to Chicago
2017-12-13 10:21:05	walter.scheirer	i have unlimited data
2017-12-13 10:21:07	walter.scheirer	no worries for me!
2017-12-13 10:21:29	pbui	i just use a sd card in my phone
2017-12-13 10:25:31	androidkitkat	is it an SD card or a SD card
2017-12-13 10:25:36	androidkitkat	bc i say an SSD
2017-12-13 10:26:03	pbui	2grammar4me
2017-12-13 10:26:14	androidkitkat	and i dont have unlimited data i just have enough data and storage where spotify caches most things
2017-12-13 10:27:10	walter.scheirer	pronounced "es-dee", which implies the use of "an"
2017-12-13 10:27:16	walter.scheirer	but you could also use a
2017-12-13 10:27:27	walter.scheirer	and it would be correct according to most style guides
2017-12-13 10:27:36	walter.scheirer	because the first S stands for Solid
2017-12-13 10:30:20	androidkitkat	I thought the S in SD stood for Secure
2017-12-13 10:30:32	androidkitkat	but im prob wrong
2017-12-13 10:30:46	walter.scheirer	really?
2017-12-13 10:30:49	androidkitkat	it is Secure Digital

2017-12-13 11:58:37	androidkitkat	all crypto needs to go up for at least a week
2017-12-13 11:58:39	jeffrey	Even my wired connection cut out for a few minutes
2017-12-13 11:58:51	androidkitkat	so once coinbase delivers mine i can seel

2017-12-13 12:04:42	androidkitkat	i stupidly bought it at its peak when i thought it would keep rising
2017-12-13 12:12:01	8bit	mflanag6: Always.
2017-12-13 12:29:32	jeffrey	Why do grad apps ask for my SSN?
2017-12-13 12:29:38	jeffrey	I don't know my SSN.
2017-12-13 12:29:40	wtheisen	it's optional
2017-12-13 12:29:44	wtheisen	almost always
2017-12-13 12:30:05	jeffrey	I always just go to insideND and download my W2
2017-12-13 12:30:10	wtheisen	Also how do you not know your SSN
2017-12-13 12:30:10	jeffrey	And copy it from that
2017-12-13 12:31:40	jeffrey	Every time I'm at the DMV or my doctors office they're like "what's your social" and I'm like no clue, and they're like "... do you know your address?"
2017-12-13 12:33:08	walter.scheirer	"have you experienced missing time, or a sensation that you have left your body?"
2017-12-13 12:36:13	androidkitkat	@wtheisen ikr
2017-12-13 13:01:44	mflanag6	I used to not know my ssn but apparently it's like a pretty essential piece of information
2017-12-13 13:02:55	8bit	I've tried memorizing it multiple times...
2017-12-13 13:04:17	8bit	thankfully now I keep on my droplet now, where I also host my website with spidey from Systems!
2017-12-13 13:05:03	mflanag6	it's not even the length of a phone number, just memorize it
2017-12-13 13:05:36	pbui	what's a SSN?
2017-12-13 13:05:38	androidkitkat	mine is 123456789
2017-12-13 13:05:53	androidkitkat	a Social Security Number?
2017-12-13 13:06:02	wtheisen	these millenials
2017-12-13 13:06:22	wtheisen	I remember when I had to memorize all my friends home phone numbers so I could reach them
2017-12-13 13:07:59	jeffrey	I'm afraid that if I memorize it someone will steal my identity
2017-12-13 13:09:05	8bit	yes, the $5 wrench attack

2017-12-13 18:04:10	jeffrey	Fam, I think compilers is up using the sakai trick
2017-12-13 18:04:41	wtheisen	exam or codegen?

2017-12-13 18:06:30	jeffrey	I have an entry for  252769 which I believe is the final

2017-12-13 18:35:48	silv3r	What’s the Sakai trick? @jeffrey
2017-12-13 18:36:50	jeffrey	View the network traffic and read the json file `startup`, which will have all of your submitted grades (including unreleased grades)
2017-12-13 18:37:29	silv3r	:3
2017-12-13 18:38:01	silv3r	_types a few things on computer, gives up_
2017-12-13 19:12:17	jeffrey	In Google chrome you right click -> inspect, go to the network tab, go to the sakai gradebook, search for startup in the network tab, and then you get a big blob of json

2017-12-13 21:03:50	alitteke	Was compilers out of 40?
2017-12-13 21:04:56	jbaker10	or was it out of 400?
2017-12-13 21:08:23	jeffrey	40
2017-12-13 21:08:27	jeffrey	Each was worth 10
2017-12-13 21:09:27	alitteke	Ok, I feel a little better then
2017-12-13 21:11:13	jbaker10	or was each worth 100!?
2017-12-13 21:19:38	jeffrey	It was 5 5 5 5 10 7 3
2017-12-13 21:20:01	jeffrey	Where only number 3 was one part worth 10
2017-12-13 21:26:03	alitteke	Ah ok that’s what I thought
2017-12-13 21:26:14	alitteke	What’s the chance you think he curves final grades?
2017-12-13 21:27:53	jeffrey	I'd wager something like 50/50
2017-12-13 21:28:33	jeffrey	He said cutoffs are at the 10s
2017-12-13 21:28:49	jeffrey	With border grades getting pluses and minuses

2017-12-13 21:53:59	androidkitkat	every disk i have either has personal files or a linux install on it
2017-12-13 21:54:52	dougsmith	every disk I own is a linux installer, boot key, or rpi image... what are "personal files"

2017-12-14 00:00:00	pbui	elementary?
2017-12-14 00:00:17	androidkitkat	not a big fan of their Design language

2017-12-14 00:01:07	androidkitkat	yeah but id rather just use apple at that point
2017-12-14 00:01:24	pbui	fair
2017-12-14 00:01:55	androidkitkat	if solus didnt break my wifi and spotify worked, id use it
2017-12-14 00:02:07	pbui	can u fix the wifi?
2017-12-14 00:02:10	androidkitkat	no clue
2017-12-14 00:02:17	pbui	maybe i can look at it tomorrow
2017-12-14 00:02:47	androidkitkat	its weird bc like i went into the "propriatary driver" section
2017-12-14 00:02:54	androidkitkat	and installed the Broadcom drivers
2017-12-14 00:03:05	androidkitkat	this was while it was working
2017-12-14 00:03:42	androidkitkat	and it doesnt work
2017-12-14 00:03:46	androidkitkat	even when uninstalling them
2017-12-14 00:03:57	androidkitkat	lspci | grep Wireless finds it
2017-12-14 00:06:37	pbui	what does dmesg say
2017-12-14 00:07:50	androidkitkat	what should i be looking for
2017-12-14 00:08:50	androidkitkat	when i look for wireless no dice
2017-12-14 00:09:09	androidkitkat	but my pc can use the bluetooth portion of my wireless car
2017-12-14 00:09:10	androidkitkat	d

2017-12-14 00:09:30	androidkitkat	i have an ethernet
2017-12-14 00:09:31	pbui	could you paste the dmesg
2017-12-14 00:09:38	androidkitkat	the whole dmesg?
2017-12-14 00:09:44	pbui	dmesg |  curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us 
2017-12-14 00:09:46	pbui	yes

2017-12-14 00:12:48	pbui	dmesg |  curl --data-binary @- https://yld.me/paste 
2017-12-14 00:12:50	pbui	use yld.me 
2017-12-14 00:13:33	androidkitkat	https://yld.me/gPA 
2017-12-14 00:14:33	androidkitkat	dont think this is relevant, but i am using Legacy Boot not UEFI
2017-12-14 00:16:31	androidkitkat	i might as well just reinstall solus
2017-12-14 00:16:38	androidkitkat	but if you can get it working
2017-12-14 00:16:44	androidkitkat	you be Linux Jesus
2017-12-14 00:16:45	pbui	i dont see a broadcom device
2017-12-14 00:16:52	androidkitkat	the b/t is BCM
2017-12-14 00:16:55	androidkitkat	i think
2017-12-14 00:16:59	pbui	but i dont see the wireless
2017-12-14 00:17:05	androidkitkat	yeah
2017-12-14 00:17:06	pbui	what does ip addr say
2017-12-14 00:17:34	androidkitkat	66.254.253.11
2017-12-14 00:17:43	androidkitkat	thats the ethernet
2017-12-14 00:18:01	androidkitkat	like the computer can see the hardware it just wont touch it
2017-12-14 00:21:36	pbui	does ip addr list a wireless card
2017-12-14 00:21:58	androidkitkat	no
2017-12-14 00:22:18	androidkitkat	only ether
2017-12-14 00:25:10	androidkitkat	ill just reinstall\
2017-12-14 00:26:22	pbui	y not
2017-12-14 00:26:26	pbui	the night is young
2017-12-14 00:26:33	pbui	androidkitkat: it seems like the driver is not loaded
2017-12-14 00:26:38	pbui	i dunno what happened
2017-12-14 00:26:43	androidkitkat	neither do i
2017-12-14 00:27:28	androidkitkat	also going to set it up as UEFI
2017-12-14 00:28:18	androidkitkat	if i even can
2017-12-14 00:29:40	androidkitkat	heres what dmesg says on the live usb just if youre wondering
2017-12-14 00:30:20	androidkitkat	yld.me/r9n 
2017-12-14 00:39:39	pbui	brcmfmac 0000:3a:00.0 wlp58s0: renamed from wlan0
2017-12-14 00:39:46	pbui	that is ur wireless driver
2017-12-14 00:40:10	pbui	i think what happened is u upgraded the kernel, but didnt updated the wireless driver
2017-12-14 00:40:21	pbui	the previous dmesg had a newer kernel
2017-12-14 00:42:55	androidkitkat	ah
2017-12-14 00:43:30	pbui	catvajiac: has a similar problem
2017-12-14 00:43:36	pbui	i bet the driver uses dkms
2017-12-14 00:43:45	pbui	which means it needs to be recompiled for each new kernel
2017-12-14 00:43:53	androidkitkat	ah
2017-12-14 00:44:18	androidkitkat	can i manually compile it
2017-12-14 00:44:52	androidkitkat	or do i need to downgrade my kernel
2017-12-14 00:45:03	pbui	with a recent kernel, i dont know if u need the proprietary driver
2017-12-14 00:46:01	pbui	https://solus-project.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=238 
2017-12-14 00:46:09	pbui	looks like they have two versions of the driver
2017-12-14 00:46:14	pbui	a lts and a current
2017-12-14 00:46:50	androidkitkat	ah
2017-12-14 00:50:00	jeffrey	@jeffrey uploaded a file: these solutions tho https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0L54J0MD/F8EDVKJTD/hw7_solutions-1.pdf 
2017-12-14 00:50:37	jeffrey	I
2017-12-14 00:50:44	jeffrey	am really salty about the algs homework solutions
2017-12-14 00:52:20	jeffrey	I think if you are going to give solutions, you should give /why/ the solutions are right, especially since 1/4th of the problem requirements is to explain why your solution is right.
2017-12-14 00:53:17	jeffrey	I figure that different TAs made different solutions, and that 2 cared more than the other 2.
2017-12-14 00:56:26	jeffrey	@pbui "a student appreciates that we are abet accreditated" - I argued in the chat a few months ago that I wouldn't have come here if we weren't ABET accredited
2017-12-14 01:06:47	androidkitkat	okay so now solus isnt working
2017-12-14 01:06:53	androidkitkat	...
2017-12-14 01:07:46	jeffrey	not booting?
2017-12-14 01:08:31	androidkitkat	it boots
2017-12-14 01:08:45	androidkitkat	but xorg isnt showing any window manager buttons
2017-12-14 01:08:52	androidkitkat	like close minimize etc
2017-12-14 01:09:00	jeffrey	good
2017-12-14 01:09:09	jeffrey	now
2017-12-14 01:09:11	jeffrey	install i3
2017-12-14 01:09:43	androidkitkat	or i just install kde neon
2017-12-14 01:09:44	jeffrey	what did you do exactly? Upgrade the kernel then revert? Or update and then just reboot?
2017-12-14 01:09:51	androidkitkat	i reinstalled from start
2017-12-14 01:10:04	jeffrey	and now it doesn't work?!
2017-12-14 01:10:13	jeffrey	is this on real hardware or a vm?
2017-12-14 01:10:57	androidkitkat	real hardware
2017-12-14 01:11:01	androidkitkat	my laptop
2017-12-14 01:11:50	jeffrey	did you reinstall from your original installation media, or did you make a new one that was potentially a different version?
2017-12-14 01:12:12	androidkitkat	i used the same one
2017-12-14 01:12:23	jeffrey	could it have been modified in some way?
2017-12-14 01:12:29	androidkitkat	nope
2017-12-14 01:12:44	androidkitkat	good thing i already had kde downloaded
2017-12-14 01:13:37	jeffrey	you know they say gnome is supposed to be better
2017-12-14 01:14:13	pbui	jeffrey: oh yeah, i remember
2017-12-14 01:14:30	androidkitkat	gnome died on me
2017-12-14 01:14:49	jeffrey	@pbui there are dozens of us, dozens!
2017-12-14 01:15:04	jeffrey	@androidkitkat I was just trying to reference Mr. Robot. I can't use kde or gnome
2017-12-14 01:16:06	androidkitkat	lol
2017-12-14 01:33:58	androidkitkat	I hate ubuntu
2017-12-14 01:35:24	pbui	androidkitkat: this thread is for u: https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxmasterrace/comments/7jlpi7/sell_me_on_your_favorite_distribution/ 
2017-12-14 01:35:35	androidkitkat	ill use Deepin
2017-12-14 01:35:40	androidkitkat	doesnt care
2017-12-14 01:35:50	androidkitkat	I cant use Ubuntu
2017-12-14 01:35:50	silv3r	Anyone have thoughts on using JavaScript to make apps
2017-12-14 01:36:09	silv3r	Using angular native / native script over swift /java
2017-12-14 01:38:31	jeffrey	I like it
2017-12-14 01:38:52	jeffrey	It becomes a big pain for things that need to use hardware
2017-12-14 01:39:12	jeffrey	And some of the systems (like phonegap) can be really hard to configure to let you do something simple like connect to a website
2017-12-14 01:39:27	androidkitkat	will i regret deepin
2017-12-14 01:39:57	silv3r	Like if I wanted to use camera / ir sensor etc?
2017-12-14 01:40:01	silv3r	Or speakers
2017-12-14 01:40:03	jeffrey	But easy cross platform, not having to deal with swift, and a lot of resources is pretty nice
2017-12-14 01:40:14	jeffrey	Camera might not be hard to use
2017-12-14 01:40:19	silv3r	Hmm ok
2017-12-14 01:40:28	jeffrey	And speakers are probably easy
2017-12-14 01:40:34	silv3r	As a busy student I think that’s the move over learning Swift / java
2017-12-14 01:40:44	silv3r	JavaScript for everything
2017-12-14 01:40:45	silv3r	Rip
2017-12-14 01:41:04	cnailos	but swift has emoji variables
2017-12-14 01:41:11	jeffrey	does javascript not?
2017-12-14 01:41:36	silv3r	I wouldn’t be surprised if it did
2017-12-14 01:41:42	jeffrey	huh, it doesn't
2017-12-14 01:41:51	jeffrey	`var 😃 = 5;`
2017-12-14 01:41:56	pbui	cnailos: go to bed
2017-12-14 01:42:00	silv3r	If anything these YouTube videos have taught me is that JavaScript has everything
2017-12-14 01:42:07	silv3r	Almost** everything
2017-12-14 01:42:08	jeffrey	`Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`
2017-12-14 01:42:18	jeffrey	Does C++?
2017-12-14 01:42:20	cnailos	pbui: i have yet to begin studying
2017-12-14 01:42:39	pbui	:coffin:
2017-12-14 01:42:42	cnailos	i slept from 2:30-10 so i got a full nights sleep
2017-12-14 01:42:48	cnailos	pm
2017-12-14 01:42:53	pbui	:ok_hand:
2017-12-14 01:42:55	silv3r	Studying is good
2017-12-14 01:43:02	silv3r	Makes you not be sad when you take exams
2017-12-14 01:43:05	silv3r	Would recommend
2017-12-14 01:43:13	cnailos	i've yet to see that scientifically proven
2017-12-14 01:44:13	cnailos	also javascript supports UTF8 so idk about emojis but you can do `var ಠ_ಠ = 5;`
2017-12-14 01:44:32	jeffrey	I am a firm believer that sleep is more important than studying.
2017-12-14 01:45:45	jeffrey	c++ should accept emoji as per the language definition
2017-12-14 01:50:36	pbui	ethics podcast hot take #3: we want capstone
2017-12-14 01:53:37	androidkitkat	So deepin wont boot
2017-12-14 01:55:04	androidkitkat	great
2017-12-14 01:59:44	androidkitkat	i might just go BACK to solus\
2017-12-14 01:59:57	pbui	third time?
2017-12-14 02:00:09	pbui	maybe u messed up w/ UEFI
2017-12-14 02:00:14	androidkitkat	but it booted
2017-12-14 02:00:17	androidkitkat	just the GUI was messed up
2017-12-14 02:00:27	pbui	sad
2017-12-14 02:00:31	pbui	should just get a mac
2017-12-14 02:01:11	androidkitkat	lol
2017-12-14 02:01:14	androidkitkat	the only issue with that
2017-12-14 02:01:17	androidkitkat	is my stickers
2017-12-14 02:04:02	silv3r	I’d love a MacBook Air if they ever make a new one smh
2017-12-14 02:04:39	alitteke	I think the new macbook air is the macbook
2017-12-14 02:04:52	androidkitkat	The price tag says otherwise but
2017-12-14 02:05:06	pbui	alitteke: should i use my startup funds to get an imac pro?
2017-12-14 02:05:13	androidkitkat	yes
2017-12-14 02:05:22	alitteke	for the shiny space blackness
2017-12-14 02:05:23	androidkitkat	that way 10 years down the line some lucky freshman gets an iMac Pro
2017-12-14 02:05:35	pbui	lol
2017-12-14 02:05:56	alitteke	can demonstrate a lot of multiproccessing on that
2017-12-14 02:06:12	alitteke	just think how fast hulk will smash on 18 cores and 256 GB of ram
2017-12-14 02:06:27	pbui	hmm
2017-12-14 02:06:32	androidkitkat	@pbui
2017-12-14 02:06:37	androidkitkat	buy a Titan V
2017-12-14 02:06:57	pbui	so the ethics podcasts have some good ideas
2017-12-14 02:06:59	cnailos	i refuse to believe the thermals on the imac pro are remotely ok, especially on the 18 core model
2017-12-14 02:07:05	pbui	im not sure how to incorporate them
2017-12-14 02:07:18	pbui	i definitely will be incorporating more testing and Ci in systems
2017-12-14 02:07:40	alitteke	Who knows? they may have learned from the Mac Pro trashcan
2017-12-14 02:07:58	pbui	one group suggested polling
2017-12-14 02:08:04	pbui	i think i can use that more
2017-12-14 02:08:08	pbui	rather than fish for answers
2017-12-14 02:08:23	alitteke	That would be interesting
2017-12-14 02:08:37	alitteke	One of my physics professors used it
2017-12-14 02:08:45	pbui	i really wish i could incorporate go or node.js in one of my classes
2017-12-14 02:08:48	alitteke	I thought it was helpful
2017-12-14 02:08:51	pbui	but i think that goes in paradigms
2017-12-14 02:09:01	pbui	yeah, but i dont like the equipment involved
2017-12-14 02:09:10	pbui	did they use like an app or was it just hands?
2017-12-14 02:09:11	cnailos	dont use iclickers
2017-12-14 02:09:13	androidkitkat	^
2017-12-14 02:09:18	pbui	i dont want to use iclickers
2017-12-14 02:09:18	alitteke	They used an app
2017-12-14 02:09:24	pbui	yeah, i dunno
2017-12-14 02:09:24	alitteke	Poll everywhere
2017-12-14 02:09:30	cnailos	cant you just do like strawpoll or something
2017-12-14 02:09:31	pbui	im too luddite for that
2017-12-14 02:09:31	alitteke	I think
2017-12-14 02:09:39	cnailos	write your own
2017-12-14 02:09:43	alitteke	https://www.polleverywhere.com 
2017-12-14 02:09:45	pbui	i dont want to fiddle w/ technology in class
2017-12-14 02:10:13	pbui	im open to what we call informal assessment
2017-12-14 02:10:32	cnailos	like when you call ppl up to code?
2017-12-14 02:10:41	androidkitkat	youve called people up to code?
2017-12-14 02:10:45	pbui	yes
2017-12-14 02:10:54	androidkitkat	i feel like id mess that up
2017-12-14 02:10:58	pbui	that's ok
2017-12-14 02:11:03	pbui	that produces teaching moments
2017-12-14 02:11:04	cnailos	some people really dont like being in the front like that tho
2017-12-14 02:11:08	pbui	yes
2017-12-14 02:11:18	pbui	that is true
2017-12-14 02:12:28	cnailos	i remember ramzi made ppl ssh to their own accounts and I was always paranoid about getting called because I name random files less-than-appropriate names sometimes when I'm frustrated
2017-12-14 02:12:49	pbui	lol
2017-12-14 02:12:57	pbui	i usually use my account
2017-12-14 02:13:00	androidkitkat	isnt that something everyone does
2017-12-14 02:14:03	alitteke	My organization is a hierarchal masterpiece to behold
2017-12-14 02:14:21	cnailos	all my project git repos sit in my home dir
2017-12-14 02:14:23	alitteke	except for the masses of files called: test.c test.py test.cpp test.js
2017-12-14 02:14:36	alitteke	And the directories that only have one file inside
2017-12-14 02:16:47	androidkitkat	i have a lot of those
2017-12-14 02:16:49	androidkitkat	on windows
2017-12-14 02:19:14	cnailos	when my laptop broke, I had OIT recover my HDD. I like to think that whatever guy was transferring the files appreciated that i had taken the time to categorize my memes,  while a folder called useless stuff was where I stored all my homework assignments
2017-12-14 02:19:33	androidkitkat	you let OIT fix your stuff?
2017-12-14 02:19:54	cnailos	theyre super cheap
2017-12-14 02:20:22	androidkitkat	id just get out the trusty Acronis True Image or some other linux tool
2017-12-14 02:20:28	cnailos	and the apple store wouldnt service it
2017-12-14 02:20:40	cnailos	the physical machine was broken lol
2017-12-14 02:21:06	androidkitkat	always keeps a drive sled handy
2017-12-14 02:21:34	pbui	g9 yall
2017-12-14 02:21:37	androidkitkat	nite
2017-12-14 02:21:40	pbui	bonne chance tomorrow
2017-12-14 02:21:46	cnailos	sleep snug, smug
2017-12-14 02:22:19	jeffrey	@alitteke my home directory is always a few directories and t.py t.c t.cpp t.s
2017-12-14 02:22:29	alitteke	let's not forget test.cminor
2017-12-14 02:22:58	jeffrey	I'm willing to bet t.c is the file name I use most
2017-12-14 07:31:04	pbui	hmm
2017-12-14 07:31:06	pbui	lots of snow
2017-12-14 07:43:48	flynn	cold too - thinking of building a fire in my office JUST KIDDING
2017-12-14 07:44:15	walter.scheirer	there is that fireplace in the old engineering library...
2017-12-14 07:44:41	flynn	Wonder if the chimney for that still exists - we will have to explore that
2017-12-14 07:53:55	flynn	figuratively
2017-12-14 08:34:13	jeffrey	Is there a fireplace on campus?
2017-12-14 08:35:09	dchiang	The student lounge is our old library???
2017-12-14 08:36:00	walter.scheirer	that's what i heard, anyway
2017-12-14 08:36:21	walter.scheirer	seems plausible, given the room is surrounded by empty shelving
2017-12-14 08:52:44	pbui	from flynn: https://cra.org/analysis-current-future-computer-science-needs-via-advertised-faculty-searches-2018/ 
2017-12-14 08:53:00	pbui	job market is hot even for cs academia
2017-12-14 08:53:46	walter.scheirer	wow, bioinformatics has the lowest demand
2017-12-14 08:54:11	flynn	Apparently the old engineering library appeared in Rudy
2017-12-14 08:54:17	walter.scheirer	lol, really?
2017-12-14 08:54:48	flynn	Yep - I was told this
2017-12-14 08:54:55	flynn	but you know gossip
2017-12-14 08:55:25	walter.scheirer	compilers a hotter area than games???
2017-12-14 08:55:47	walter.scheirer	i think i'm OK with that
2017-12-14 08:57:10	walter.scheirer	the fact that there are so few arch. postings bodes well for us
2017-12-14 09:30:23	pbui	games isnt really a research area
2017-12-14 09:30:47	pbui	a number of schools have more vocational game programming CS programs
2017-12-14 09:30:53	pbui	but there isnt much research in that field
2017-12-14 09:31:56	walter.scheirer	game AI
2017-12-14 09:31:58	walter.scheirer	graphics
2017-12-14 09:32:05	walter.scheirer	HCI
2017-12-14 09:32:12	walter.scheirer	there's quite a bit of interesting research one can do
2017-12-14 09:32:25	walter.scheirer	AR/VR
2017-12-14 09:32:28	pbui	ai, gfx, hci are broken out into their own categories
2017-12-14 09:32:35	walter.scheirer	true
2017-12-14 09:32:53	pbui	if u aggregate all of those, u'd have more jobs than compilers
2017-12-14 09:33:21	pbui	either way data science and security is where it is currently at
2017-12-14 09:33:38	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-12-14 09:34:07	pbui	https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/12/disney-to-buy-part-of-21st-century-fox-for-52-billion/ 
2017-12-14 09:34:13	pbui	disney could own deadpool?
2017-12-14 09:34:15	pbui	oh no
2017-12-14 09:43:42	catvajiac	hey good luck today OS people!
2017-12-14 09:47:51	pbui	o7
2017-12-14 09:49:10	jeffrey	o7
2017-12-14 10:04:17	wtheisen	at what point is disney considered a monopoly? They own way too much already
2017-12-14 10:05:18	jeffrey	They will own like a quarter of their market.
2017-12-14 10:06:01	jeffrey	I'm not happy with their whole make their own streaming service thing though
2017-12-14 10:06:11	jeffrey	And now they own a lot of Hulu
2017-12-14 11:01:50	wtheisen	they own a lot of everything
2017-12-14 11:05:19	wtheisen	I can't believe their size doesn't bother you @jeffrey
2017-12-14 11:07:40	wtheisen	also is anyone else's internet just foobar rn?
2017-12-14 11:08:04	pbui	Yes
2017-12-14 11:13:44	wtheisen	How am I supposed to avoid studying if I can't play videogames?
2017-12-14 11:15:12	pbui	I dunno
2017-12-14 11:15:40	wtheisen	when is the exam pbui?
2017-12-14 11:15:47	pbui	Now
2017-12-14 11:16:01	wtheisen	how many tears have been shed thus far?
2017-12-14 11:16:14	pbui	None
2017-12-14 11:31:11	wtheisen	holy cow this internet
2017-12-14 11:39:32	walter.scheirer	yes, the internet is an exciting thing
2017-12-14 11:39:46	wtheisen	no it's absolutely crawling for me rn
2017-12-14 11:39:52	wtheisen	This is unbearable
2017-12-14 11:40:18	walter.scheirer	It's OK in Stinson
2017-12-14 11:42:33	wtheisen	anyone seen the star wars movie yet?
2017-12-14 12:06:39	8bit	Anybody else get some lag right after they unplug their laptop?
2017-12-14 12:09:21	pbui	wtheisen: it's a net neutrality simulation
2017-12-14 12:09:48	pbui	Just pay up and all will be better
2017-12-14 12:24:46	wtheisen	woah my ND fee got waived

2017-12-14 16:07:56	ewilli23	re: polling: my physics professor handed us sheets on the first day with 1-4 printed on one side and 5-8 printed on the other. He had us fold them so that our answer was showing and just hold up the cards
2017-12-14 16:08:09	ewilli23	technology-free polling
2017-12-14 16:11:10	pbui	ewilli23: ive heard of the card technique before
2017-12-14 16:11:15	pbui	how many kids in the class
2017-12-14 16:11:22	pbui	im not sure that scales to 150
2017-12-14 16:11:33	pbui	cs majors can take capstone i think
2017-12-14 16:11:36	pbui	even if they arent cpeg
2017-12-14 16:11:39	pbui	it's just no one does
2017-12-14 16:13:02	ewilli23	We filled up one of the lecture halls in Nieuwland. So yeah idk about systems. Could work in something like OS though
2017-12-14 16:14:45	pbui	yeah, i can see it in OS
2017-12-14 16:14:48	pbui	so how did it work?
2017-12-14 16:15:07	pbui	he asked a question, and kids just held up their card?
2017-12-14 16:15:22	pbui	ive heard this w/ colored index cards
2017-12-14 16:15:37	pbui	how often did he poll the class?
2017-12-14 16:16:54	ewilli23	Yeah. tbf I didn’t really go to that lecture all that much
2017-12-14 16:17:06	ewilli23	But as I recall he polled most class days that I was there
2017-12-14 16:22:06	ewilli23	PollEverywhere is a pretty popular option though.
2017-12-14 17:09:44	jeffrey	Why are compiler grades disabled now
2017-12-14 17:14:14	pbui	did u hack the system?

2017-12-14 17:51:10	silv3r	Birthdays are a ruse by big pharma to make us age, and then need to buy medication to stay healthy

2017-12-14 19:16:18	walter.scheirer	and comcast is flaky again... i blame the net neutrality repeal
2017-12-14 19:17:13	jeffrey	i wonder if they ever do things like throttle heavily during peak hours, then have high bandwidth during off hours, and be like "well, your average bandwidth is 25Mb/s, so..."
2017-12-14 19:17:22	walter.scheirer	ha
2017-12-14 19:19:36	pbui	comcast is charging me an extra $1.50 this month
2017-12-14 19:19:39	pbui	why? who knows
2017-12-14 19:19:43	pbui	i blame obama
2017-12-14 19:19:44	walter.scheirer	i hate that
2017-12-14 19:51:59	wtheisen	Oh no I have to install npm feelsbadman
2017-12-14 19:54:33	pbui	shouldnt that be npm install feelsbadman
2017-12-14 20:01:02	ewilli23	Are you sure Reddit is/was down or did ND just not buy the Reddit package from Comcast?
2017-12-14 20:01:29	pbui	reddit violates dulac
2017-12-14 20:01:34	pbui	so it has been let go
2017-12-14 20:01:57	jeffrey	@wtheisen I think codegen grades are visible with the sakai trick
2017-12-14 20:02:56	jeffrey	MY BOSS FROM TWO SUMMERS AGO JUST POSTED AN ANTI NET NEUTRALITY THING ON FACEBOOK
2017-12-14 20:03:08	pbui	fire him

2017-12-14 20:03:21	cnailos	which thing in the network inspector has the grades?
2017-12-14 20:03:22	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-14 20:03:27	ewilli23	Actually though if this whole thing goes into effect like people think it will how will ND decided which packages to buy?
2017-12-14 20:03:45	jeffrey	`startup` @cnailos
2017-12-14 20:04:01	ewilli23	Or will it be like TV where people have to sign up for individual subscriptions if they want to pay for anything above the baseline
2017-12-14 20:04:01	walter.scheirer	@jeffrey: i didn't know you did an internship at the FCC
2017-12-14 20:04:03	walter.scheirer	coughs
2017-12-14 20:04:38	wtheisen	They really need to fix that sakai hack
2017-12-14 20:04:46	jeffrey	I might make a browser plugin that shows hidden sakai grades
2017-12-14 20:05:20	pbui	boys just want one thing... sakai grades
2017-12-14 20:05:24	pbui	cant do the meme right
2017-12-14 20:05:32	ewilli23	I think the sakai hack only works for classes using the “Gradebook 2” on sakai
2017-12-14 20:05:58	jeffrey	You sure they posted the grades at all?
2017-12-14 20:06:09	ewilli23	My circuit analysis class uses “Gradebook” (which has a much nicer interface and seems newer) and I don’t think the hack works
2017-12-14 20:06:27	jeffrey	Algs has gradebook and it is just gradebook 2
2017-12-14 20:06:38	cnailos	i feel like the grades arent even in a particular order
2017-12-14 20:07:46	walter.scheirer	i refuse to use any of those services
2017-12-14 20:07:52	walter.scheirer	especially sakai
2017-12-14 20:08:08	ewilli23	But Sakai is open source!
2017-12-14 20:08:23	walter.scheirer	ha
2017-12-14 20:08:48	ewilli23	Actually that’s a good point @jeffrey you should submit a pull request to fix that hack
2017-12-14 20:09:11	ewilli23	Idk where the gradebook code is though; if that’s part of Sakai or somewhere else
2017-12-14 20:25:59	pbui	ewilli23: grades up, gj, highest grade so far
2017-12-14 20:26:41	ewilli23	In the class or on the exam? Bc I thought I bombed that exam
2017-12-14 20:26:55	pbui	exam
2017-12-14 20:27:31	ewilli23	:open_mouth:

2017-12-14 20:27:57	cnailos	its like a 60
2017-12-14 20:28:17	cnailos	_guessing_
2017-12-14 20:29:38	jeffrey	Ugh what if I don't get in anywhere
2017-12-14 20:30:47	walter.scheirer	then you have to get a job
2017-12-14 20:30:58	walter.scheirer	or go on funemployment
2017-12-14 20:32:02	ewilli23	@pbui you didn’t make them visible
2017-12-14 20:32:19	ewilli23	_is too lazy to comb through the json_

2017-12-14 20:36:51	cnailos	instead of finding the size of the double indirect pointer i drew that. overall id say it was worth the points lost

2017-12-15 03:56:45	jeffrey	They gotta admit me
2017-12-15 04:07:18	jeffrey	And Cornell will be like "why you fail algs?" And I'll be like "I was reading about one of your profs"
2017-12-15 04:08:27	jeffrey	And UMass will be like "why you fail algs?" And I'll be like "I watched a video from a PhD from CMU who showed reduction from graph coloring by coloring in a picture of a horse."
2017-12-15 04:12:34	jeffrey	Why does the wells fargo app need to be updated

2017-12-15 08:43:37	wtheisen	It was a linear time, pre-computed run
2017-12-15 08:43:41	wtheisen	So no
2017-12-15 08:44:01	wtheisen	O(2n + m)
2017-12-15 08:51:55	jeffrey	Fam,  $3 says one of the algs questions will be "show that the lower bound of convex hull is nlogn"
2017-12-15 08:52:58	wtheisen	that sounds hard
2017-12-15 08:54:44	jeffrey	For each element x in the set you want to sort, put (x, x^2) on a graph, then run convex hull on that
2017-12-15 08:55:02	jeffrey	If you traverse the created boundary you would follow the points in sorted order
2017-12-15 08:55:40	jeffrey	It is O(n) to go to and from that, so the lower bound of sorting applies to convex hull as well
2017-12-15 08:57:23	phale1	I'm scared
2017-12-15 09:00:44	jeffrey	@phale1 Mario kart tonight?
2017-12-15 09:02:25	jeffrey	My last undergraduate exam thoooo
2017-12-15 09:08:10	phale1	I have plans otherwise I would!
2017-12-15 09:23:03	phale1	If this exam gives me diabetes issues think I won't have to take it?
2017-12-15 09:23:25	wtheisen	that sounds unethical
2017-12-15 09:23:37	wtheisen	imma be honest probably worth a shot though
2017-12-15 09:31:50	jeffrey	$5 says one question will be "John says that X problem is NP complete because " and then an algorithm for X that uses a known NP hard problem to solve X, and then "is he right?"
2017-12-15 09:32:53	wtheisen	I'll take you up on that one
2017-12-15 09:33:00	wtheisen	also just got a free fridge
2017-12-15 09:33:03	wtheisen	feelsgoodman
2017-12-15 09:34:56	jeffrey	Ok, three hours and the nightmare of Algs will be over
2017-12-15 09:35:13	wtheisen	you'll be fine @jeffrey
2017-12-15 09:35:18	wtheisen	you'll kill it
2017-12-15 09:35:23	jeffrey	I'm way more worried about grad apps
2017-12-15 09:35:38	jeffrey	But I'm also worried I'll just space out on a question or 2 during algs
2017-12-15 09:35:50	jeffrey	Like that one discrete midterm
2017-12-15 09:36:11	jeffrey	Where it asked something like how many ways can you organize the alphabet so 10 letters are in order
2017-12-15 09:36:30	wtheisen	@wtheisen uploaded a file: image.png https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0KQYK7DK/F8ELUDUV6/image.png 
2017-12-15 09:36:32	jeffrey	And then it asked how many 7 digit numbers have their digits sum to 9
2017-12-15 09:36:44	jeffrey	And I put down nothing for those two problems
2017-12-15 09:36:53	wtheisen	wait the gif isn't playing
2017-12-15 09:37:07	jeffrey	That's a png
2017-12-15 09:37:13	jeffrey	Maybe slack can't do animated pngs
2017-12-15 09:37:15	wtheisen	this is better
2017-12-15 09:37:33	wtheisen	right click copy image doesn't copy gifs in chrome apparently
2017-12-15 09:37:35	wtheisen	@wtheisen uploaded a file: itllbegreat.gif https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0KQYK7DK/F8GCV2UQP/itllbegreat.gif 
2017-12-15 09:38:05	jeffrey	What can he ask about graph algorithms though
2017-12-15 09:40:40	jeffrey	Also not a fan of the lack of hw8 grades
2017-12-15 09:48:32	phale1	Same
2017-12-15 09:49:00	phale1	Bill I am taking this exam screwed up sugars or not
2017-12-15 09:49:15	phale1	I took my OS final with a low blood sugar and made it through
2017-12-15 09:49:18	phale1	It was painful
2017-12-15 09:49:23	phale1	But I did it
2017-12-15 09:49:42	jeffrey	Personally I wanna hear happy give the speech from independents day
2017-12-15 09:49:49	jeffrey	Independence
2017-12-15 09:50:45	phale1	I've never seen it
2017-12-15 09:50:48	phale1	But I'll do it
2017-12-15 09:52:18	ewilli23	https://youtu.be/oj16vfbsM9A 
2017-12-15 10:00:27	wtheisen	cheat sheet status: printed
2017-12-15 10:02:05	wtheisen	4 pages is a lot
2017-12-15 10:02:22	wtheisen	I started printing full wiki articles at the end
2017-12-15 10:02:22	jeffrey	Ikr
2017-12-15 10:02:26	jeffrey	Lol
2017-12-15 10:06:55	phale1	wait looking back
2017-12-15 10:07:01	phale1	what does he mean by transformation
2017-12-15 10:12:41	wtheisen	good luck guys, see you on the other side
2017-12-15 10:17:18	catvajiac	good luck algs people!
2017-12-15 10:23:36	phale1	In actuality my pump did run out of battery
2017-12-15 10:25:28	phale1	I brought a spare
2017-12-15 10:25:44	phale1	But if this bodes for how the exam will go I'm scared

2017-12-15 11:51:04	walter.scheirer	oh windows...

2017-12-15 11:54:50	phale1	IM FREEEEEEEE
2017-12-15 11:55:31	walter.scheirer	congrats!
2017-12-15 11:59:02	phale1	Also Walter I have not gotten an email with those documents....who should I contact?
2017-12-15 11:59:16	walter.scheirer	which documents?
2017-12-15 11:59:24	walter.scheirer	we sent you the paper via slack
2017-12-15 12:00:25	catvajiac	hey gj phale1 :)
2017-12-15 12:00:28	catvajiac	go relax!
2017-12-15 12:10:40	phale1	Ah I thought there was another paper
2017-12-15 12:10:44	phale1	Perhaps I was mistaken
2017-12-15 12:11:07	walter.scheirer	oh, i think we may have suggested you look at the of the other papers from the project in addition
2017-12-15 12:11:10	walter.scheirer	i will send you links in a PM
2017-12-15 12:18:02	jeffrey	@phale1 you live?
2017-12-15 12:22:48	walter.scheirer	the silence is not reassuring
2017-12-15 12:23:27	catvajiac	she'll be missed
2017-12-15 12:23:48	jeffrey	Rip Happy, 1994-2017
2017-12-15 12:55:27	phale1	1995
2017-12-15 12:56:09	jeffrey	I considered that
2017-12-15 12:56:20	jeffrey	But I figured you were more than 6 months older than me
2017-12-15 12:59:55	walter.scheirer	wow, i was hacking linux kernel code back in 1995...
2017-12-15 13:17:36	jbaker10	me too
2017-12-15 13:18:47	jeffrey	Anyone else down for Mario kart tonight?
2017-12-15 13:41:03	ssjohns	Guys! I'm going to Austin in March and Reddit is having a few famous artist perform at parties. Last year we had Snoop Dogg.
2017-12-15 13:41:47	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-15 13:44:30	jeffrey	I don't buy thain's answer for taking away our gradebook
2017-12-15 13:44:45	walter.scheirer	"you can't handle the truth!"
2017-12-15 13:45:10	jeffrey	I can't handle anything right now, I'm exhausted
2017-12-15 13:45:23	jeffrey	And I gotta do grad apps and NLP
2017-12-15 13:50:51	ssjohns	Hey what's that link sharing thing everyone always uses? @jeffrey
2017-12-15 13:51:01	ssjohns	Like you can use it from the commandline

2017-12-15 13:58:54	ssjohns	Lol, I only needed it for one thing.
2017-12-15 13:59:28	ssjohns	Apparently I lose shaqhacks in a few onths if I don't renew the droplet.

2017-12-15 14:31:43	walter.scheirer	wow, the demise of shaqhacks
2017-12-15 14:31:45	walter.scheirer	that could be the end of an era
2017-12-15 15:11:39	jeffrey	"You do not have to fill out additional paperwork for your spring TA position. You are all set to begin work as soon as Professor Scheirer needs you to." ummm
2017-12-15 15:11:55	jeffrey	@dchiang did you trade me to @walter.scheirer
2017-12-15 15:12:11	walter.scheirer	lol

2017-12-15 15:12:42	walter.scheirer	hmmm...
2017-12-15 16:42:00	ssjohns	@jeffrey?? You follow me on IG?
2017-12-15 16:42:10	ssjohns	I didn't even know you had one.
2017-12-15 16:42:17	jeffrey	umm no?
2017-12-15 16:42:24	jeffrey	that was on facebook for me
2017-12-15 16:42:30	jeffrey	does facebook own IG?
2017-12-15 16:42:40	ssjohns	Ohh my bad. Yeah sorry.
2017-12-15 16:42:46	ssjohns	And yes fb does own ig.
2017-12-15 16:42:53	ssjohns	It's how they plan to kill snapchat.
2017-12-15 16:43:03	jeffrey	but they don't got snap glasses
2017-12-15 16:43:28	ssjohns	Snap glasses failed pretty badly haha. Also Snap lost $2 billion this year.
2017-12-15 16:48:17	jeffrey	Submitted UMass, so 2 down, 2 to go today
2017-12-15 16:56:42	ssjohns	@jeffrey Apply to Berkeley.

2017-12-20 11:40:47	pbui	The backlash against higher education is real... I experienced it at uwec
2017-12-20 11:41:14	pbui	I'm somewhat surprised that even ND is not immune from it
2017-12-20 11:41:20	wtheisen	it’s 100% warranted though
2017-12-20 11:42:12	pbui	While I agree with the sentiment that ND and other elites don't do enough, I'm not convinced the tax addresses the problem
2017-12-20 11:42:34	pbui	It's more of a gotcha rather than a real fix
2017-12-20 11:42:43	wtheisen	we spent 400 million on expansions to the football stadium
2017-12-20 11:43:49	pbui	Crossroads is more than the stadium though, it is also a student center and new academic buildings
2017-12-20 11:44:06	pbui	That happen to be next to the stadium
2017-12-20 11:44:30	wtheisen	I think Notre Dame is a very elitist school, students and faculty alike
2017-12-20 11:44:39	pbui	Look, I'm not a big fan of the project, but it is important that we get the facts right
2017-12-20 11:45:05	pbui	Define elitist
2017-12-20 11:45:53	wtheisen	we just think we’re better than everyone, and students are usually wealthy white kids
2017-12-20 11:46:10	pbui	I can see that
2017-12-20 11:46:33	pbui	I'm not sure how faculty play into that
2017-12-20 11:48:52	ewilli23	I agree that we’re elitist
2017-12-20 11:48:53	ewilli23	I think the admin has more to do with that than faculty though
2017-12-20 11:48:59	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-20 11:49:01	wtheisen	College in and of itself is a self-propagating system of elitism
2017-12-20 11:49:11	wtheisen	okay yeah, admin, not faculty that’s the word
2017-12-20 11:49:15	walter.scheirer	my lab is the suite of the elite baby
2017-12-20 11:50:07	walter.scheirer	31337
2017-12-20 11:50:50	ewilli23	Pro tip: request an official transcript the day before your hold starts and it’ll still go through, but because it takes a couple days to process it’ll have your new grades
2017-12-20 11:51:37	jeffrey	Really?
2017-12-20 11:51:51	wtheisen	unfortunately college instills a false sense of superiority in most students, and that continues the dislike of collegiate students, because they’re all dicks
2017-12-20 11:51:52	jeffrey	So U mass will know my grades before me?
2017-12-20 11:52:31	ewilli23	Yeah I requested a transcript on Sunday and got it today and it has my fall grades on it
2017-12-20 12:17:24	pbui	wtheisen: we actually talk about this at the beginning of ethics
2017-12-20 12:42:38	wtheisen	good I’ll have some hot takes about it
2017-12-20 12:42:46	wtheisen	man I hate college kids
2017-12-20 12:48:03	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-20 12:48:51	wtheisen	most kids are exactly like pip in great expectations
2017-12-20 12:56:29	walter.scheirer	protagonists in a bildungsroman?
2017-12-20 12:58:17	wtheisen	what a word. they’re like when pip goes home for the first time and he’s like “i’m a gentleman and rich now, everyone will love me” and it’s like no ur just a dick

2017-12-20 16:48:40	pbui	come on bros
2017-12-20 16:49:16	walter.scheirer	RIP ND in the citrus bowl
2017-12-20 16:49:33	walter.scheirer	"If Stepherson misses Notre Dame’s upcoming Citrus Bowl, the Irish will be without two of their top three targets when they take on LSU. Stepherson has 19 catches for 359 yards on the season. Kelly announced last week that sophomore wide receiver Chase Claypool injured his shoulder in practice and will sit out the bowl game due to the injury."
2017-12-20 16:50:00	pbui	it's not like we pass the ball anyways
2017-12-20 17:52:30	cnailos	"Stepherson was arrested for shoplifting a pair of sweatpants from Macy's at the University Park Mall in Mishawaka. He was picked up walking out of the store wearing an allegedly stolen $59 pair of Nautica sweatpants."
2017-12-20 17:52:30	cnailos	bruh... at least take something worth shoplifting
2017-12-20 17:54:17	ewilli23	Sweatpants?
2017-12-20 17:54:24	ewilli23	All the free UA swag isn’t enough?
2017-12-20 19:00:52	jeffrey	I must confess
2017-12-20 19:01:11	jeffrey	I deleted my Ubuntu partition and installed Windows, for the vidyo games
2017-12-20 19:01:31	jeffrey	When the Christmas ends, I will install arch on this, and be pure once more
2017-12-20 19:04:52	dougsmith	Nothing but arch? Or just a partition?
2017-12-20 19:05:05	dougsmith	How can one game without windows?
2017-12-20 19:11:58	jbaker10	you could use Mac ;)

2017-12-21 09:24:27	pbui	oh hey, we did this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15974483 
2017-12-21 09:27:08	pbui	their malloc assignment is much more hardcore than mine...
2017-12-21 09:29:33	pbui	we didnt focus on performance at all
2017-12-21 09:39:45	pbui	wait, this was a sigcse paper and it had nsf funding?
2017-12-21 09:39:51	pbui	i could have done this...
2017-12-21 09:39:53	pbui	sigh
2017-12-21 09:42:36	pbui	looking at the actual lab writeup, this just simulates malloc
2017-12-21 09:42:42	pbui	it doesnt directly use sbrk or mmap
2017-12-21 09:43:02	pbui	we actually replaced malloc and used the system calls, even allowed untouched binaries to use our malloc
2017-12-21 09:43:13	pbui	so in that sense, we were actually more low level, which is pretty neat
2017-12-21 09:43:17	pbui	take that CMU

2017-12-21 10:55:35	walter.scheirer	"Many major donors insist their funds be used for specific purposes. Others don’t even give money. Princeton University, for example, would struggle to convert the largest gift in its history into tuition assistance: a collection of 2,500 rare books valued at almost $300 million."

2017-12-21 14:48:50	androidkitkat	its a 6S+
2017-12-21 14:48:59	androidkitkat	and its a "new" 32 GB one
2017-12-21 14:49:06	androidkitkat	so its not a launch phone
2017-12-21 14:49:09	alitteke	hm
2017-12-21 14:49:28	androidkitkat	i bet apple used refurb parts in the "new" 6S phones

2017-12-21 19:09:22	ewilli23	Yeah
2017-12-21 19:09:32	ewilli23	Thankfully it’s not a laptop
2017-12-21 19:09:51	ewilli23	But mac keyboards are ridiculously expensive

2017-12-21 21:42:49	jeffrey	I think my first Ethics blog will be me ranting about the movie Home Alone
2017-12-21 21:47:25	pbui	what's wrong w/ home alone
2017-12-21 21:47:42	jeffrey	the first 70 minutes of it
2017-12-21 21:47:55	jeffrey	and that it is a movie
2017-12-21 21:48:56	jbaker10	i never quite understood why there were so many of them
2017-12-21 21:49:05	jeffrey	$$$
2017-12-21 21:55:07	wtheisen	i can’t wait to display my true power level in ethics
2017-12-21 22:02:21	jeffrey	I'm still not sure if I go serious, troll, or what
2017-12-21 22:07:24	jbaker10	does it actually matter?
2017-12-21 22:08:06	jeffrey	Why would it not?
2017-12-21 22:09:30	wtheisen	yeah I don’t know if I can go all the way in on it
2017-12-21 22:09:45	wtheisen	I don’t want to get ostracized
2017-12-21 23:26:47	ewilli23	https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/apple-sued-in-chicago-for-slowing-down-older-iphones/ 
2017-12-21 23:35:51	alitteke	That feels like a dumb lawsuit to try to make
2017-12-21 23:37:28	alitteke	I feel like the people trying to make the claim kinda contradict themselves
2017-12-21 23:46:28	ewilli23	What do you mean contradict themselves
2017-12-21 23:46:36	8bit	jeffrey: do you have something against Home Alone
2017-12-21 23:50:53	ewilli23	@ewilli23 uploaded a file: Image uploaded from iOS https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U3SRYR1P1/F8HRANQ1F/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg  and commented: @walter.scheirer giving cards to lug, 2017, colorized
2017-12-21 23:51:50	alitteke	"They're making it so I have to get a new phone, but it can be fixed if I replace my battery"
2017-12-21 23:52:13	alitteke	Is what it sounds like they're saying
2017-12-21 23:52:23	ewilli23	Yeah
2017-12-21 23:53:33	alitteke	If Apple truly made this change because of the phones crashing because it asks to much from the battery, throttling the CPU makes the phone last longer, although they should've been more transparent
2017-12-21 23:53:41	ewilli23	Like they’re not getting a new phone bc they’re unhappy with their battery life, but because their phone is slow. But Apple never told them that replacing the battery would speed up their phone.
2017-12-21 23:53:57	alitteke	And they should do that
2017-12-21 23:53:58	ewilli23	Yeah I think the transparency is the issue
2017-12-21 23:54:06	alitteke	But it crashing is also not expected behavior
2017-12-21 23:54:18	alitteke	and that's sort of a physics issue
2017-12-21 23:54:41	alitteke	they did try to make expected behavior, which is the phone not crashing, be the more ideal state
2017-12-21 23:54:53	alitteke	But they should say so
2017-12-21 23:55:05	ewilli23	Yeah I don’t think the argument is that they shouldn’t have done it, but that they were being deceptive about it
2017-12-21 23:56:12	ewilli23	They should have said “if your phone is slowing down, pay us $99 to replace your battery,” not “if your phone is slowing down, spend $800 to buy a new phone”
2017-12-21 23:56:45	alitteke	I don't think the people making this case will win if only because Apple doesn't _have_ to disclose this since they never actually say how fast it's supposed to go in the first place
2017-12-21 23:57:18	alitteke	I don't know the ins and outs, but I don't know if it's entirely viable
2017-12-21 23:57:46	ewilli23	Idk though I think it falls under deceptive marketing practices
2017-12-21 23:58:08	alitteke	but they didn't lie when asked
2017-12-21 23:58:50	ewilli23	Now, but the official line up till now has been that the phones just slow down bc newer OSs require more resources
2017-12-21 23:59:02	ewilli23	Regardless I’m sure they’ll settle
2017-12-21 23:59:06	alitteke	This feature wasn't rolled out until iOS 11
2017-12-21 23:59:10	ewilli23	Then continue to do it
2017-12-21 23:59:18	ewilli23	Oh really
2017-12-21 23:59:23	ewilli23	I hadn’t heard that
2017-12-21 23:59:37	alitteke	I think so
2017-12-21 23:59:57	ewilli23	Wait so then why did crashing suddenly become an issue
2017-12-22 00:00:07	alitteke	It was always a problem in the older phones
2017-12-22 00:00:17	alitteke	this was the update they decided to try to do something about it
2017-12-22 00:00:30	ewilli23	It was?
2017-12-22 00:00:57	alitteke	I've had people that have had problems that they're phones used to die with like 40% left occasionally after 2 years of use
2017-12-22 00:03:31	alitteke	Or like when phones got cold with low battery they'd crash
2017-12-22 00:09:23	ewilli23	I know people talk about phones suddenly dying with charge left but it seems like if that were the sort of peak-current issue Apple describes than your phone should be able to restart
2017-12-22 00:09:44	ewilli23	But usually after it crashes like that you get a dead-battery sign
2017-12-22 00:10:11	alitteke	I have had those happen too, I think it's a mix depending on where your battery is when it died
2017-12-22 00:10:28	alitteke	From everything I've heard, it seems to come in with iOS 11
2017-12-22 00:11:27	ewilli23	Apple’s statement says they rolled it out a year ago
2017-12-22 00:11:54	alitteke	oh, iOS 11.2 is when they're doing it with the 7 maybe
2017-12-22 00:11:57	ewilli23	So yeah it’s not as big a conspiracy as people are making it out to be
2017-12-22 00:12:02	ewilli23	Yes
2017-12-22 00:12:04	alitteke	It's really not
2017-12-22 00:12:14	ewilli23	But still they should’ve been more transparent
2017-12-22 00:12:16	alitteke	It's a transparency issue yes
2017-12-22 00:12:29	alitteke	I think apple was hoping their implementation was a little cleaner
2017-12-22 00:12:40	alitteke	and that it didn't hit phones so suddenly
2017-12-22 00:12:50	ewilli23	Also according to reddit comments the same thing happens to MacBooks, even if they’re running off AC
2017-12-22 00:13:08	ewilli23	And to my knowledge they’ve never announced anything like this
2017-12-22 00:13:18	alitteke	they haven't
2017-12-22 00:16:29	androidkitkat	@a3qz can you get on the xbox team and enable same console halo 5 campaign
2017-12-22 00:17:35	a3qz	Unfortunately that team only has a few openings and I didn't get one
2017-12-22 00:17:47	a3qz	I know someone who did though I'll see what I can do
2017-12-22 00:19:29	androidkitkat	Or at least let halo 6 have the noble team from Reach
2017-12-22 00:20:17	androidkitkat	Noble 6 ex machina
2017-12-22 06:44:35	ssjohns	Did bitcoin just crash?

2017-12-22 07:17:35	walter.scheirer	but it tends to do that

2017-12-22 07:32:30	pbui	lol
2017-12-22 07:33:29	pbui	we probably still ended up trying to throw it 70% of the time
2017-12-22 09:07:06	walter.scheirer	And there’s still over a week to go before the game

2017-12-22 09:12:04	pbui	id do it

2017-12-22 10:42:00	pbui	hmm
2017-12-22 10:42:24	pbui	epic just emailed me, one of our students got an internship there and they were impressed and want me to send them more students
2017-12-22 10:42:29	pbui	i think it is a form email though
2017-12-22 10:42:33	pbui	still, pretty cool
2017-12-22 10:43:45	silv3r	LUG student or general cse student?
2017-12-22 10:44:27	pbui	general cse
2017-12-22 10:44:42	silv3r	Why’d they email u lol
2017-12-22 11:30:43	pbui	i dunno
2017-12-22 11:30:48	pbui	so impressed i guess
2017-12-22 11:30:54	pbui	i was a reference for the student

2017-12-22 11:37:26	wtheisen	that comic is so accurate
2017-12-22 11:37:34	ssjohns	Also, we got a Christmas bonus. I'm so happy.
2017-12-22 11:42:36	pbui	ssjohns: grats
2017-12-22 11:42:51	pbui	re: epic, i heard it depends on the type of position
2017-12-22 11:43:06	pbui	consultants burn out quickly at epic
2017-12-22 12:08:46	walter.scheirer	@pbui and i got paid yesterday; that's almost like a Christmas bonus
2017-12-22 12:08:51	walter.scheirer	coughs

2017-12-22 15:43:20	ssjohns	Yep. One to one correlation.
2017-12-22 15:54:01	myle_killer	If I was sitting down to start a project when would I chose Go? Like is it just good for when you need concurrency? Or does it have other merits too?
2017-12-22 15:54:27	pbui	portabilility
2017-12-22 15:54:33	pbui	performance
2017-12-22 15:54:41	pbui	go compiles down to a single static executable
2017-12-22 15:54:46	pbui	so it's easier to deploy
2017-12-22 15:54:57	myle_killer	Oh really? Always?
2017-12-22 15:54:57	pbui	b/c it's compiled, it's generally faster than say python
2017-12-22 15:55:08	pbui	yes, go generates static executables by design
2017-12-22 15:55:27	myle_killer	Ohh that’s awesome
2017-12-22 15:56:03	pbui	go has a lot of things builtin
2017-12-22 15:56:16	pbui	so if u want a middle ground between python and c++, go is a good candidate
2017-12-22 15:56:55	myle_killer	Makes sense, since I’ve never used it does t have a steep learning curve?
2017-12-22 15:57:05	pbui	i dont think so
2017-12-22 15:57:11	myle_killer	Makes sense, since I’ve never used it does it have a steep learning curve?
2017-12-22 15:57:16	pbui	at uwec, i taught comp arch by starting w/ golang
2017-12-22 15:57:24	pbui	to teach them concurrency and parallelism
2017-12-22 15:57:29	pbui	most people were able to pick it up
2017-12-22 15:57:33	pbui	it's very c-like
2017-12-22 15:57:56	pbui	i recommend u just work through the go playground
2017-12-22 15:58:02	pbui	!give myle_killer !g go playground

2017-12-22 15:58:47	pbui	oops
2017-12-22 15:58:52	pbui	i meant a tour of go: https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1 
2017-12-22 15:59:07	pbui	it will walk you through the basic syntax of the language
2017-12-22 15:59:08	myle_killer	Thanks!
2017-12-22 16:00:35	pbui	also: http://www.golang-book.com/books/intro 
2017-12-22 16:02:51	myle_killer	Awesome thank you! Maybe I’ll try to implement one of our os projects in go, I feel like that would be a good way to dive in
2017-12-22 16:04:02	pbui	cool
2017-12-22 16:04:07	pbui	i wish i could teach OS in go
2017-12-22 16:04:10	pbui	maybe one day
2017-12-22 16:04:13	wtheisen	the shell would be cool

2017-12-22 16:04:50	pbui	i sort of want to do go in systems
2017-12-22 16:04:57	pbui	but we dont have the bandwidth for that
2017-12-22 16:07:18	myle_killer	Didn’t you say at the beginning of os we had the option to do the projects in go if we wanted?
2017-12-22 16:07:39	pbui	i dont remember
2017-12-22 16:07:42	pbui	maybe for one of them
2017-12-22 16:09:06	myle_killer	Ahh maybe that’s what I was just for the first project
2017-12-22 17:04:33	walter.scheirer	Just landed... at the wrong airport

2017-12-22 17:10:31	ewilli23	Did another major airport lose power?
2017-12-22 17:10:49	silv3r	Or did you walk onto the wrong plane

2017-12-22 17:17:19	walter.scheirer	Which actually isn’t far from here
2017-12-22 17:17:48	walter.scheirer	I could probably rent a car and drive there if this flight never takes off
2017-12-22 17:26:29	jeffrey	Just drive
2017-12-22 17:26:37	jeffrey	Or come visit me
2017-12-22 17:27:04	jeffrey	I guess Allentown is closer than Harrisburg, and I'm currently headed to Amherst
2017-12-22 17:27:08	jeffrey	So don't visit me
2017-12-22 17:36:51	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-22 17:37:15	walter.scheirer	That was a pretty narrow window for a visit

2017-12-22 22:21:21	wtheisen	no wonder no one is impressed when I say ND back home
2017-12-22 22:43:21	wtheisen	anyone have a copy of a gen chem practice final?
2017-12-22 22:43:25	wtheisen	please?

2017-12-22 22:45:25	silv3r	I do too actually
2017-12-22 22:45:35	silv3r	I archived my gen chem folder someone gave me
2017-12-22 22:45:36	wtheisen	just a recent one
2017-12-22 22:45:37	androidkitkat	I have a gdrive folder with a ton
2017-12-22 22:45:40	silv3r	Multiple practice finals
2017-12-22 22:45:50	wtheisen	I need to prove a point to my semester

2017-12-22 22:46:41	silv3r	Good luck @wtheisen
2017-12-22 23:02:24	wtheisen	thanks guys
2017-12-22 23:02:29	wtheisen	point was proven
2017-12-23 00:52:45	jbaker10	Aka it’s easy?
2017-12-23 09:14:41	wtheisen	my mom was telling me that my sister could totally do our gen chem because she got an A at wittenberg
2017-12-23 09:14:51	wtheisen	I said otherwise
2017-12-23 10:02:04	pbui	what was her reaction to the sample exam
2017-12-23 10:03:30	wtheisen	@wtheisen uploaded a file: Image uploaded from iOS https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0KQYK7DK/F8JS6S51A/image_uploaded_from_ios.gif 
2017-12-23 10:05:07	pbui	lol
2017-12-23 10:05:17	pbui	it's sort of like the ball state situation
2017-12-23 10:05:29	pbui	ND may not be top tier, but we arent terrible
2017-12-23 10:05:38	pbui	i dare say we are pretty good
2017-12-23 10:05:46	pbui	far from perfect of course
2017-12-23 10:05:52	wtheisen	aren’t we top tier though?
2017-12-23 10:06:13	pbui	in CS?
2017-12-23 10:07:23	pbui	i dont think so
2017-12-23 10:07:58	wtheisen	not CS just in general
2017-12-23 10:08:02	pbui	again, we are good (imo), but i wouldnt put us near the top
2017-12-23 10:08:27	pbui	meh, general rankings are meaningless to me
2017-12-23 10:08:35	pbui	i think we are like 14-18 or something
2017-12-23 10:10:15	pbui	wtheisen: i take it that your friends and family are not impressed u go to ND
2017-12-23 10:32:58	wtheisen	it’s not that they’re not impressed, just that they can’t fathom how much more difficult it is
2017-12-23 10:33:43	pbui	do they get it now?
2017-12-23 10:34:03	wtheisen	haha my sister does
2017-12-23 10:34:55	wtheisen	if you go from getting all As to getting all As it’s probably hard to imagine
2017-12-23 10:36:12	wtheisen	suppose that’s what you did though
2017-12-23 10:42:29	pbui	i was humbled my first year by gen chem and calc
2017-12-23 10:42:50	pbui	wtheisen: http://third-bit.com/teaching/ 
2017-12-23 10:43:01	pbui	that has a lot of really good pro-tips about teaching
2017-12-23 12:17:38	wtheisen	thanks, I’ll read it when I get home. Anybody think the ayyyy lmao Pentagon thing is real this time? There’s surprisingly little reaction to it
2017-12-23 14:17:42	walter.scheirer	possibly because it's a hoax

2017-12-23 14:53:47	wtheisen	awwwww
2017-12-23 14:54:00	wtheisen	knew it was too good to be true

2017-12-23 19:31:21	silv3r	Does anyone have a solution for screen tearing in Ubuntu? I got my nvidia drivers installed and messed with the settings to get vsync to work properly, but it’s still tearing in most videos. WM is gnome
2017-12-23 20:05:41	wtheisen	compton?
2017-12-23 20:08:47	silv3r	I use pantheon but I can switch to XFCE I guess
2017-12-23 20:40:52	wtheisen	you don’t have to be on xfce for compton do you? @jeffrey
2017-12-23 20:55:13	jeffrey	I do nod
2017-12-23 20:55:46	jeffrey	@silv3r I had screen tearing when web browsing with Ubuntu so got angry and broke my laptop.

2017-12-24 13:07:54	jeffrey	Once for the fourth Sunday of advent and once for Christmas
2017-12-24 13:08:08	jeffrey	According to my priest, who just wants more friends
2017-12-24 13:58:40	jeffrey	Why is GPS still blocked for me? I can view my grades, but not my graduation progress.
2017-12-24 14:16:08	pbui	jeffrey: yeah, our priest told us the same thing
2017-12-24 14:16:23	pbui	does anyone have experience w/ a chromecast w/ a dual band router?
2017-12-24 14:16:40	pbui	our chromecast doesnt appear to work w/ our new dual band router
2017-12-24 14:16:48	pbui	it takes a long time to be discovered (10 min)
2017-12-24 14:16:55	pbui	if it ever gets discovered
2017-12-24 14:17:13	pbui	i looked around an google says chromecast needs to run on the 2.4ghz band
2017-12-24 14:17:34	pbui	anyway, i switched back to my old router and it gets discovered right away
2017-12-24 14:17:38	pbui	so im guessing that is the problem

2017-12-24 14:51:42	jeffrey	What are you doing with it @wtheisen ?
2017-12-24 14:52:19	wtheisen	i’m following a tutorial for python
2017-12-24 14:52:40	wtheisen	It’s supposed to make little creatures that chase down food and evolve over generations
2017-12-24 14:52:54	wtheisen	I’m trying to add a visualization to it atm
2017-12-24 14:53:12	wtheisen	Then I’ll mod the creatures and the reproduction paramus
2017-12-24 15:15:41	wtheisen	coding is a lot harder without wifi though:grimacing:
2017-12-24 15:16:03	silv3r	What Tutorial?

2017-12-24 15:17:19	wtheisen	It’s really simple
2017-12-24 15:17:36	wtheisen	but animating it is proving hard without docs
2017-12-24 15:18:27	silv3r	:+1::skin-tone-4:
2017-12-24 15:18:33	silv3r	Found my next project
2017-12-24 15:21:44	wtheisen	I’ll let you know if I get animation working

2017-12-25 12:53:22	walter.scheirer	Indeed
2017-12-25 12:55:21	catvajiac	i was just away from computers for a week and it was weird

2017-12-25 13:30:04	jeffrey	I don't think there was a dig, my dad just likes the "some other third thing" line from The SpongeBob Squarepants movie
2017-12-25 14:22:33	wtheisen	We are out of the house for 6 days, and my mom brought 5 different bags of her stuff. like wtf is with that

2017-12-25 16:57:43	bdevorem	My dad refuses to "learn technology" so he only knows how to call (no texting) on his Motorola razr. He breaks it every year and we have to buy a new one off eBay bc they don't sell them anymore
2017-12-25 17:05:05	walter.scheirer	A razr may be too new fangled for my grandmother

2017-12-26 17:01:37	silv3r	The comments were amusing too

2017-12-26 14:49:43	jeffrey	3D, but still
2017-12-26 19:54:48	ssjohns	@ssjohns uploaded a file: Image uploaded from iOS https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0KCN2GG1/F8JQG08CQ/image_uploaded_from_ios.png  and commented: I love bugs. Specially since I have friends at Slack now.

2017-12-26 20:03:08	walter.scheirer	that's not a bug; it's a feature

2017-12-27 11:03:26	dchiang	did current juniors do a recursive descent parser in systems last year?
2017-12-27 11:08:42	pbui	dchiang: no
2017-12-27 11:09:27	pbui	the sophomores will do a scheme interpreter in DS this spring, but the juniors dont have that experience (at least not as a group)
2017-12-27 11:14:28	pbui	!weather
2017-12-27 11:14:29	bobbit	@pbui: Current weather is 2.57°F, Light Snow
2017-12-27 11:14:42	silv3r	What
2017-12-27 11:14:58	silv3r	That’s Fahrenheit right
2017-12-27 11:15:03	walter.scheirer	oofff
2017-12-27 11:15:05	pbui	yes
2017-12-27 11:15:11	silv3r	Yikes
2017-12-27 11:15:24	pbui	w/ windchill it feels like -5
2017-12-27 11:15:38	dchiang	it dipped below zero last night, right?
2017-12-27 11:15:48	pbui	yeah, i think so
2017-12-27 11:15:50	walter.scheirer	looks like things will warm up just as i return next week
2017-12-27 11:15:51	walter.scheirer	hehe
2017-12-27 11:15:59	silv3r	D: I’m glad to have migrated down to the south for the time being
2017-12-27 11:16:19	pbui	i want to go to the store, but i dont want to freeze
2017-12-27 11:16:32	pbui	i mean im used to it from my time in eau claire
2017-12-27 11:16:39	walter.scheirer	solution: amazon
2017-12-27 11:16:42	pbui	i just dont like it
2017-12-27 11:16:46	silv3r	Amazon fresh
2017-12-27 11:16:51	pbui	need to get some baking soda
2017-12-27 11:16:55	pbui	for experiments
2017-12-27 11:16:57	pbui	...
2017-12-27 11:17:03	walter.scheirer	does south bend have task rabbit?
2017-12-27 11:17:09	pbui	no idea
2017-12-27 11:17:36	pbui	also my house is a lego construction zone right now
2017-12-27 11:17:44	walter.scheirer	+10
2017-12-27 11:17:46	silv3r	Tfti
2017-12-27 11:17:55	pbui	cant walk anywhere w/out stepping on one
2017-12-27 11:20:02	dchiang	@pbui try using bleach
2017-12-27 11:20:05	dchiang	JUST KIDDING
2017-12-27 11:20:09	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-27 11:22:01	silv3r	I was confused until I looked up ‘bleach and vinegar’
2017-12-27 11:22:04	silv3r	Yikes
2017-12-27 11:23:12	walter.scheirer	santa must have left *somebody* the anarchist cookbook...
2017-12-27 11:23:32	pbui	im still working on declogging the sink
2017-12-27 11:23:37	pbui	drano doesnt really work
2017-12-27 11:23:47	pbui	but ive had some success w/ baking soda and vinegar
2017-12-27 11:24:10	pbui	this is my last resort until i buy a drain snake
2017-12-27 11:24:13	walter.scheirer	not sure that combo will dissolve legos...
2017-12-27 11:24:29	dchiang	oh i thought it was a science expt with your kids
2017-12-27 11:24:34	silv3r	+10
2017-12-27 11:24:44	pbui	the kids will help
2017-12-27 11:24:55	pbui	if i can get them to step away from their legos
2017-12-27 11:26:16	dchiang	actually drano is basically bleach, isn't it
2017-12-27 11:26:46	walter.scheirer	certainly smells that way
2017-12-27 11:32:25	dchiang	i've had a couple of drains that had large objects very close to the top, left behind by previous owner
2017-12-27 11:33:08	dchiang	what kind of drain is it
2017-12-27 11:37:37	pbui	it's the kitchen sink drain
2017-12-27 11:37:50	pbui	the clog is not in the pipes directly underneath the sink
2017-12-27 11:38:04	pbui	ive taken that part out and cleaned it
2017-12-27 11:39:49	dchiang	how much guidance do students need to implement their first RD parser?
2017-12-27 11:40:36	dchiang	(a) the grammar (b) lookahead rules (c) explanation of what RD is (d) pseudocode (e) example run
2017-12-27 12:14:35	pbui	i did (a), briefly (c), and provided (d)
2017-12-27 12:14:47	pbui	im not sure about (e)
2017-12-27 12:26:50	jbaker10	I personally like seeing small examples of how certain things are actually working. I know Dchiang did that in data structures. So many scrabble tiles
2017-12-27 12:27:55	pbui	dchiang: https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.30331.fa16/project01.html 
2017-12-27 12:40:00	dchiang	yeah scheme doesn't need (b)
2017-12-27 13:20:32	dchiang	but i've been having second thoughts about how much you learn by translating pseudocode into code -- what do students think
2017-12-27 13:21:15	walter.scheirer	i've always felt that there's more value in translating mathematical expressions into code
2017-12-27 13:21:40	walter.scheirer	pseudocode is often an unnecessary middle step
2017-12-27 13:21:46	walter.scheirer	but i may be biased, given my research
2017-12-27 13:21:52	walter.scheirer	also, i am not a student
2017-12-27 13:21:54	walter.scheirer	:stuck_out_tongue:

2017-12-27 14:41:03	walter.scheirer	"ixy is designed for educational purposes to learn how a network card works at the driver level. Lack of kernel code and external libraries allows you to look through the whole code from startup to the lowest level of the driver. Low-level functions like handling DMA descriptors are rarely more than a single function call away from your application logic."
2017-12-27 14:41:08	walter.scheirer	this is extremely cool

2017-12-27 15:47:56	pbui	atypical
2017-12-27 15:48:25	walter.scheirer	?
2017-12-27 15:48:32	tweninger	^^?
2017-12-27 15:48:39	pbui	Tim describes himself as “an atypical computer scientist who doesn’t study programming languages or compilers or circuits”.
2017-12-27 15:48:45	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-27 15:48:56	tweninger	:smile: I didn't write it... haven't read it myself
2017-12-27 15:49:05	tweninger	my graduate students texted it to me
2017-12-27 15:49:10	walter.scheirer	@pbui is preparing to kick-ban @tweninger from #lug
2017-12-27 15:49:10	pbui	tweninger: y u gotta keep getting internet points
2017-12-27 15:49:26	tweninger	internet famous?
2017-12-27 15:49:53	pbui	also, y u hate on archies
2017-12-27 15:49:54	tweninger	read by tens of...
2017-12-27 15:50:01	tweninger	...people
2017-12-27 15:50:06	pbui	just b/c concrete takes a long time to dry
2017-12-27 15:50:22	tweninger	aint nobody got time for that
2017-12-27 15:51:34	silv3r	You gave a ted talk?
2017-12-27 15:51:49	tweninger	^^ about 3 years ago I guess
2017-12-27 15:52:26	silv3r	Lol same about the archi thing tho
2017-12-27 15:53:00	silv3r	Was considering KU/KSU architecture then decided I didn’t like drawing for 8 hrs a day
2017-12-27 15:53:22	tweninger	instead we pound on a keyboard for 14-16 hours per day?
2017-12-27 15:53:34	silv3r	:raised_hands::skin-tone-4:
2017-12-27 15:53:40	tweninger	I suppose architects get to go outside sometimes
2017-12-27 16:17:47	wtheisen	I'm looking at apartments, being an adult is no bueno
2017-12-27 16:18:11	walter.scheirer	could be worse... you could be looking at houses
2017-12-27 16:18:31	wtheisen	:grimacing:
2017-12-27 16:19:58	wtheisen	what do normal people spend money on?
2017-12-27 16:20:34	walter.scheirer	housing?
2017-12-27 16:20:36	walter.scheirer	hehe
2017-12-27 16:20:58	tweninger	GPUs?
2017-12-27 16:21:11	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-27 16:21:13	wtheisen	yeah but other than that? What do I have to budget for? I'm a single male that sits inside on a computer all day
2017-12-27 16:21:17	walter.scheirer	*normal people*
2017-12-27 16:21:18	walter.scheirer	not us...
2017-12-27 16:21:26	walter.scheirer	housing, food
2017-12-27 16:21:42	walter.scheirer	car, if you have one
2017-12-27 16:21:43	tweninger	housing, food, utilities, vehicle expenses
2017-12-27 16:21:55	wtheisen	ahhh vehicles that's right
2017-12-27 16:22:00	pbui	their kids
2017-12-27 16:22:32	wtheisen	I suppose I'll have to get furniture at some point
2017-12-27 16:22:38	walter.scheirer	thrift store bro
2017-12-27 16:22:55	walter.scheirer	furniture won't be a major expense
2017-12-27 16:22:57	tweninger	furniture is pretty inexpensive relative to
2017-12-27 16:23:25	pbui	lawn chairs for days
2017-12-27 16:23:28	walter.scheirer	i bought my current furniture from a law student
2017-12-27 16:23:44	pbui	i didnt buy furniture until i got the ND job
2017-12-27 16:23:51	walter.scheirer	nice
2017-12-27 16:23:53	pbui	so for 3 years in eau claire our living room was empty
2017-12-27 16:23:58	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-27 16:24:00	wtheisen	guess I'll just chuck it all in a retirement fund
2017-12-27 16:24:24	tweninger	car and health and life insurance takes some money
2017-12-27 16:24:32	pbui	yeah, minivan killed us
2017-12-27 16:24:35	walter.scheirer	he doesn't need life insurance
2017-12-27 16:24:36	tweninger	if you're single you wont need life instance
2017-12-27 16:24:51	pbui	what a great way to start off my professoring career... finding out u have twins
2017-12-27 16:24:55	wtheisen	oh insurance is a thing too
2017-12-27 16:25:06	walter.scheirer	it's pretty cheap
2017-12-27 16:25:31	wtheisen	Would I get anything via the university or no?
2017-12-27 16:25:45	walter.scheirer	the university would provide you with options
2017-12-27 16:25:51	walter.scheirer	but you still have to pay some small fee
2017-12-27 16:26:17	walter.scheirer	keep in mind dental insurance at most schools (including ND) is more like a discount
2017-12-27 16:26:38	walter.scheirer	you probably want to keep an "emergency fund" on-hand
2017-12-27 16:26:47	walter.scheirer	for unexpected largish expenses
2017-12-27 16:26:58	tweninger	wtheisen what are you planning for... I haven't kept up in this channel. Are you looking for grad school?
2017-12-27 16:27:23	wtheisen	how much is a largish expense? like 1k or like 10k @tweninger yeah gonna try and get my PhD
2017-12-27 16:27:31	wtheisen	be like you guys
2017-12-27 16:28:00	tweninger	the rule of thumb is to keep 3-6 months of your salary in the bank
2017-12-27 16:28:13	tweninger	as an emergency fund
2017-12-27 16:28:15	wtheisen	oh wow
2017-12-27 16:28:18	wtheisen	okay
2017-12-27 16:28:21	tweninger	i never did this
2017-12-27 16:28:28	tweninger	and still dont
2017-12-27 16:28:53	jeffrey	Before or after tax?
2017-12-27 16:29:14	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-12-27 16:29:14	walter.scheirer	i do
2017-12-27 16:29:23	tweninger	after I guess... its an estimate for "large-ish" expense
2017-12-27 16:29:31	walter.scheirer	after is fine
2017-12-27 16:29:35	wtheisen	that's another question, how does the stipend I'd get be taxed?
2017-12-27 16:29:43	walter.scheirer	before if you are paranoid
2017-12-27 16:29:53	tweninger	depends on the stipend
2017-12-27 16:29:57	walter.scheirer	it gets taxed at whatever rate your salary qualifies for
2017-12-27 16:30:00	tweninger	I had NDSEG and NSF fellowships
2017-12-27 16:30:19	wtheisen	so it's like getting salary? and you're paid once a month?
2017-12-27 16:30:21	tweninger	NDSEG was taxed like a regular salary, they took some amount every month
2017-12-27 16:30:35	tweninger	NSF i had to pay quarterly amounts to goverment
2017-12-27 16:30:48	tweninger	99% you'll be taxed like a regular employee
2017-12-27 16:30:53	jeffrey	All governments or just federal?
2017-12-27 16:31:23	walter.scheirer	it's a regular salary
2017-12-27 16:31:25	tweninger	well federal is the only one that really matters. as a graduate student you're state tax will be a hundred buck is all
2017-12-27 16:31:40	jeffrey	I don't want to be a state tax
2017-12-27 16:31:42	tweninger	anyways, 99% chance for you that it'll be regular witholdings
2017-12-27 16:32:00	wtheisen	100 a month or 100 a year?
2017-12-27 16:32:04	tweninger	then you'll get back a few bucks in the spring
2017-12-27 16:32:33	jeffrey	My state charged me $2 =(
2017-12-27 16:32:49	tweninger	dont let me confuse the situation, just assume you'll be taxed like a regular employee
2017-12-27 16:32:51	jeffrey	And I assume I'll make more as a grad student
2017-12-27 16:34:06	tweninger	when I was a graduate student my #1 expense was housing and utilities, followed by food, then internet and phone, then car expenses
2017-12-27 16:34:23	pbui	wtheisen: at ND, it's a regular salary
2017-12-27 16:34:38	pbui	u are paid twice a month i think
2017-12-27 16:34:48	pbui	and u are taxed like a regular employee
2017-12-27 16:34:52	pbui	i think i even paid indiana taxes
2017-12-27 16:35:04	pbui	and st joe county taxes
2017-12-27 16:36:05	walter.scheirer	grad students are indeed paid twice a month here
2017-12-27 16:36:23	walter.scheirer	you would make a handsome salary of $30K a year
2017-12-27 16:36:27	walter.scheirer	at ND
2017-12-27 16:36:30	tweninger	yeah something around 30-35K annually
2017-12-27 16:36:58	tweninger	it'll be similar at other universities
2017-12-27 16:37:14	walter.scheirer	adjusted for cost of living
2017-12-27 16:37:25	walter.scheirer	big cities pay out a lot more
2017-12-27 16:37:34	tweninger	Walter you think so? Ithink its 35 at Stanford
2017-12-27 16:37:51	tweninger	CMU pays less than ND
2017-12-27 16:37:55	walter.scheirer	i think they have subsidized housing
2017-12-27 16:37:57	walter.scheirer	at stanford
2017-12-27 16:38:11	walter.scheirer	Pittsburgh isn't a big city, and it's cheap
2017-12-27 16:38:19	walter.scheirer	I'm thinking Boston, NYC
2017-12-27 16:38:22	tweninger	for faculty, I don't know about grad students
2017-12-27 16:38:38	tweninger	NYC does pay more, but not much
2017-12-27 16:38:42	tweninger	NYU**
2017-12-27 16:38:55	walter.scheirer	they may also have subsidized housing
2017-12-27 16:39:30	tweninger	I chose UIUC over Berkeley primarily because the living standard that the respective salaries could afford
2017-12-27 16:39:37	tweninger	(I was getting married at the time)
2017-12-27 16:40:11	tweninger	of course this is ancient history now 8 years ago
2017-12-27 16:40:13	walter.scheirer	colorado was amazingly affordable when i did my phd
2017-12-27 16:40:16	walter.scheirer	that is no longer true
2017-12-27 17:15:05	dchiang	Philly too
2017-12-27 17:39:01	jeffrey	Philly is no longer affordable?
2017-12-27 17:39:15	walter.scheirer	it's pretty affordable
2017-12-27 17:39:21	walter.scheirer	compared to other major cities
2017-12-27 17:39:25	walter.scheirer	though getting more expensive
2017-12-27 18:07:42	wtheisen	does anyone here do a passthrough set-up with their desktop?
2017-12-27 23:14:30	dchiang	mi rogue nation
