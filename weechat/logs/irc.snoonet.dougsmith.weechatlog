I don't want to make things awkward, I don't want you to feel like you have to avoid certain places or people or anything because of me. This is solely between you and me and that is where I would like it to stay. I don't feel super
2017-11-06 22:17:06	camelot	comfortable talking to you right now, but I will be eventually. Don't take it personally. You hurt me and I just need some time. I know it wasn't intentional or even visible to you, but nevertheless that's what happened. I'm sorry for being a bitch today, I distract myself when I'm sad by getting angry and lashing out and I'm sorry about that. I don't know what else to say so I'll just say this
2017-11-06 22:17:06	camelot	again. We're still friends, I really love that we are, but I am going to need time before things are totally okay again.

2017-11-07 00:11:10	dougsmith	I'm sorry I hurt you. Whether intentional or no, I said what I felt and you have a right to be hurt. Then I didn't say it strongly enough and lead you on.
2017-11-07 00:12:02	dougsmith	I'm sorry you don't feel like you can talk to me, because that's the ultimate expression of letting you down, but I get it.
2017-11-07 00:13:59	dougsmith	You've been fine. I hope yopu actually are going to be okay and not just saying so. I'll stop trying to engage you and you can talk to me when you're ready, or never, I deserve whatever judgement you pass at this point.
