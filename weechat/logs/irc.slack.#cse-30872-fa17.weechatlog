2017-10-19 04:23:41	dougsmith	For challenge 14, can we solve in a language that doesn't support classes using structs and really good names (Go/C)? Or do we have to use a language with OO support?
2017-10-19 00:45:45	pbui	U don't need Oop
2017-10-19 00:47:25	dougsmith	+thanks
2017-10-19 01:51:53	dougsmith	Also, the binary tree definition you link us to says the a parent is >= left children and <= right children, implying duplicates could go to either side. Since our code will need to consistently favor one or the other, should we assume new duplicate values go to the left or to the right?
2017-10-19 08:00:42	pbui	there is no left, right
2017-10-19 08:01:04	pbui	since u can have multiple children
2017-10-19 08:01:15	pbui	err more than 2
2017-10-19 10:46:53	catvajiac	ain't it binary tho?
2017-10-19 10:47:06	catvajiac	-ccarball, and me too [cc: ccarball]
2017-10-19 10:59:52	pbui	no
2017-10-19 11:00:43	catvajiac	aight thx
2017-10-19 11:01:18	pbui	`(+ 1 2 3 4)`
2017-10-19 11:01:25	pbui	that is not binary
2017-10-19 11:04:11	pbui	dougsmith: for a bst, u can put equivalent values on the right
2017-10-19 11:27:45	aayala4	for division in challenge14, do you want it to round as if you were just doing integer division?
2017-10-19 11:31:10	pbui	yes, use integer division
2017-10-19 11:52:07	aayala4	will the only time that an input isn't wrapped in outer parentheses be if it's just a standalone number? like would it ever be + 1 2 3 vs. (+ 1 2 3)
2017-10-19 11:58:21	pbui	only if it is a single number
2017-10-19 11:58:27	pbui	u will not get + 1 2 3
2017-10-19 13:06:52	dougsmith	pbui: sorry, I meant for challenge13 (the one that links to binary trees)
2017-10-19 13:08:03	pbui	aight, put equal items to the right
2017-10-19 14:12:41	aayala4	and to clarify, everything is evaluated left to right within a specific expression? so (- 3 1 2) would be 0? and (/ 12 4 3) would be 1?
2017-10-19 14:15:14	pbui	yes
2017-10-19 14:25:33	aayala4	could someone look at my challenge14? it works correctly for the test input and all of the input tests that I can think of, but it's still failing dredd
2017-10-19 14:46:33	pbui	aayala4: i have to go home right now, but ill check in an hour
2017-10-19 14:46:36	pbui	hang tight
2017-10-19 16:25:16	pbui	aayala4: you are failing on `(+ (1) (2))`
2017-10-19 16:25:24	pbui	you output `1` instead of `3`
2017-10-20 00:24:45	aayala4	thank you i was able to fix the bug
2017-10-20 00:28:07	pbui	gj
2017-10-21 01:48:33	nbrooks3	I just put in a couple of zeros and some other recent grades. Heads up. Thanks all!
2017-10-21 15:06:35	dougsmith	For challenge13, can we assume that we will be given the tree nodes in BFS traversal order?
2017-10-21 15:13:35	pbui	no
2017-10-21 15:13:42	pbui	u have to build the tree in the order given
2017-10-21 15:13:54	pbui	so the tree might be unbalanced
2017-10-21 15:14:06	pbui	also, shouldnt u be getting ready to play in the band
2017-10-21 15:14:09	pbui	not hacking
2017-10-21 15:19:42	dougsmith	But code written in band uniform is the best code.
2017-10-21 15:21:09	pbui	that's true
2017-10-21 15:21:15	pbui	cant argue w/ fax like that
2017-10-21 15:24:57	dougsmith	You don't ever dress up before hacking for heightened productivity?
2017-10-21 15:28:17	pbui	i sometimes put on a hoodie
2017-10-21 15:28:59	dougsmith	Very l33t
2017-10-21 15:30:11	pbui	i think linus does most of his kernel hacking in a bathrobe
2017-10-21 15:30:16	pbui	but that is too formal for me
2017-10-21 15:33:14	dougsmith	So I'm doing the exact opposite of what Linus Torvalds does? Not feeling great about my choices.
2017-10-22 15:02:10	hermantong	for challenge13, I'm getting Execution Error even though my program.cpp compiles and runs fine on my local machine. Is there something that I've done wrong?
2017-10-22 15:03:17	pbui	you are segfaulting on some edge case
2017-10-22 15:11:25	hermantong	got it ty!!
2017-10-22 15:35:10	seiseman	I'm unable to change the target branch for my merge requests. Anytime I try, gitlab tells me there was an error on their end. This was happening yesterday as well
2017-10-22 15:36:54	pbui	could u show a screenshot
2017-10-22 15:38:04	seiseman	For starters, when I change to a branch the option to merge doesnt even come up. A screenshot is coming shortly though...
2017-10-22 15:41:42	seiseman	@seiseman uploaded a file: fire_gitlab.JPG https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U27CU8UCW/F7N7D07C5/fire_gitlab.jpg 
2017-10-22 15:45:08	pbui	who is ur TA?
2017-10-22 15:46:24	seiseman	janicki
2017-10-22 15:46:52	pbui	https://gitlab.com/seiseman/cse-30872-fa17-assignments/merge_requests/21 
2017-10-22 15:46:57	pbui	i created a merge request for u
2017-10-22 15:46:59	pbui	it worked for me
2017-10-22 15:47:07	seiseman	weird
2017-10-22 15:47:09	pbui	but #firegitlab indeed
2017-10-22 15:47:19	seiseman	it also isnt working for os
2017-10-22 15:47:26	seiseman	guess I'm just bad
2017-10-22 15:51:04	jmcguin1	in challenge13 does the example test case tree correspond to the photo? because if so I'm struggling to understand how
2017-10-22 15:52:54	pbui	hmm
2017-10-22 15:53:19	pbui	seiseman: try clearing your cache or something
2017-10-22 15:53:24	pbui	or try in a incognito window
2017-10-22 15:54:10	pbui	jmcguin1: yes, where is the confusion
2017-10-22 15:59:15	seiseman	incognito doesnt fix it. Guess I'll clear the cache
2017-10-22 16:03:03	dougsmith	General browsing question, doesn't incognito equate to empty cache?
2017-10-22 16:03:18	seiseman	cache didnt fix it either
2017-10-22 16:03:51	jmcguin1	isn't the left child at index 2k and the right child at 2k+1?
2017-10-22 16:08:34	pbui	seiseman: let me see it tomorrow before class
2017-10-22 16:08:40	pbui	and we ll see if we can determine what is going on
2017-10-22 16:09:08	pbui	jmcguin1: u are not given an array representing the bst
2017-10-22 16:09:17	pbui	u are given a sequence of numbers that u must insert into the bst
2017-10-22 16:09:25	jmcguin1	ok got it
2017-10-22 16:10:38	seiseman	Sounds good. Although, I just tried merging the os reading even though it said they had an error and it seems to have worked just fine. Maybe the error is that the error bar appears erroneously
2017-10-22 16:17:52	pbui	possible

2017-10-22 22:13:48	zaccendejas	I have the same problem as seiseman, but I also have a limited TA list after the error so I can't assign my correct TA either.
2017-10-22 22:34:08	ccarball	 
2017-10-22 22:34:10	ccarball	:
2017-10-22 22:34:38	ccarball	sorry
2017-10-22 22:34:59	8bit	jk:wq
2017-10-22 22:48:06	pbui	zaccendejas: we can take a look at it tomorrow
2017-10-23 13:35:27	tlynch2	for challenge13 are we to assume that the root is the first node in the input?
2017-10-23 13:47:09	pbui	yes
2017-10-23 13:47:18	pbui	it has to be, since u are inserting it
2017-10-23 13:49:13	tlynch2	Then could you take a look at my challenge13 please because I'm not sure what's wrong with it, its passing all of the test cases I try
2017-10-23 13:49:49	pbui	do u have spaces between each tree?
2017-10-23 13:50:11	tlynch2	in the input or in the output?
2017-10-23 13:51:55	tlynch2	nevermind, got it thank you
2017-10-23 13:56:45	tlynch2	But could you look at my challenge14, I'm getting an execution error, but I don't know why
2017-10-23 14:00:20	pbui	you are dying on this line: `(+ (+ (+ (+ 1 1) (+ 1 1)) (+ (+ 1 1) (+ 1 1))) (+ (+ (+ 1 1) (+ 1 1)) (+ (+ 1 1) (+ 1 1))))`
2017-10-23 20:10:03	dchao	for challenge13 can we assume any nodes we are given to find the common ancestor for will be valid nodes already in the tree?
2017-10-23 20:21:27	pbui	yes
2017-10-24 12:53:01	showley1	can we expect that if an operation must be done, it will be inside of parenthesis? for instance, + 1 2 3 will never happen. instead it will be (+ 1 2 3)
2017-10-24 13:58:16	pbui	yes
2017-10-24 13:58:21	pbui	it will always be in parens

2017-10-26 18:06:40	seiseman	Do we need to verify that a pair of nodes in actually in the tree?
2017-10-26 19:22:22	seiseman	Further question; are we supposed to end the program on a -1, or is does -1 follow the last pair for each tree?
2017-10-26 19:22:52	jjohns48	I believe it is the last for each tree
2017-10-26 19:29:20	pbui	seiseman: the pair of nodes will be in the tree

2017-10-26 19:52:28	8bit	lol
2017-10-26 19:53:07	catvajiac	phale1: +yes
2017-10-26 19:53:09	pbui	no, it's a _treat_ for them

2017-10-26 19:56:09	pbui	s/schemer/trickster/
2017-10-26 20:14:59	seiseman	The first number of the nodes line is the root, but beyond that we can we make any assumptions as to the other nodes? Can we assume, for example, that the 4th number entered is the left child of the left child of the root?
2017-10-26 20:18:04	pbui	no
2017-10-26 20:18:21	pbui	u have to insert into a BST
2017-10-26 20:26:28	seiseman	will they always be in breadth first order? Or only root first?
2017-10-26 20:26:57	pbui	the first node is only the root, b/c it is the first node
2017-10-26 20:27:11	pbui	all u have to do for each value is insert it into your bst
2017-10-26 20:27:20	pbui	u should have a bst class/object/w/e
2017-10-26 20:27:26	pbui	and do bst.insert(value)
2017-10-26 20:27:29	pbui	that's basically it
2017-10-26 20:27:46	pbui	the insert should keep the constraints of the bst
2017-10-26 20:27:54	pbui	that is all nodes to the left are less than the current
2017-10-26 20:28:05	pbui	all values to the right are greater
2017-10-26 20:28:11	pbui	(or equal)
2017-10-26 20:28:49	seiseman	I was trying to use an array, since I didn't catch that it wasn't given as a bst (although I should have noticed taht nothing was done to account for the gaps...) and I wasnted to change as little as possible, but I think a real tree is easier at this point
2017-10-26 20:29:03	seiseman	wanted*
2017-10-26 20:29:52	pbui	u could do this w/ an array
2017-10-26 20:30:05	pbui	u would end up w/ the same logic though
2017-10-26 20:30:10	pbui	so u dont gain much from it
2017-10-26 22:38:10	seiseman	I re-did the problem to account for bst and want not, but I am still getting an execution error
2017-10-26 22:38:51	jjohns48	do you have a merge request? i can take a look at the code
2017-10-26 22:38:51	seiseman	I handle nodes not in the tree since that does crash it, but I can;t think of what else to handle
2017-10-26 22:41:41	seiseman	https://gitlab.com/seiseman/cse-30872-fa17-assignments/tree/challenge13/challenge13 
2017-10-26 22:45:29	jjohns48	i made a mistake earlier, the -1 is for the entire input not each tree
2017-10-26 22:46:13	pbui	dammit jjohns48
2017-10-26 22:52:36	seiseman	Does a line get printed after every tree, or only if there is a subsequent tree?
2017-10-26 22:53:00	pbui	between each tree
2017-10-26 23:00:28	seiseman	but not at the very end?
2017-10-26 23:01:23	seiseman	I'm still getting execution errors either way
2017-10-26 23:02:03	pbui	yes, not at the end
2017-10-27 00:22:59	8bit	Are we to interpret (/ 1 2 3 4) as (((1/2)/3)/4)?
2017-10-27 00:49:52	tmurray5	^^^
2017-10-27 00:56:09	aayala4	yeah everything is evaluated left to right in order
2017-10-27 00:56:21	8bit	thank you
2017-10-27 00:56:23	aayala4	^ur question also applies to subtractin
2017-10-27 00:56:54	8bit	Awesome.  I had seen the subtraction one answered before but wasn't sure if it was analagous for division.  thanks
2017-10-27 18:56:28	andrewbub	on challenge13 I'm getting an execution error although valgrind is reporting no errors. What does the execution error mean?

2017-10-30 12:45:30	nbrooks3	I'll be holding my regularly scheduled office hours tonight in Stinson tonight at 6:30 EST if anyone needs a hand or otherwise wants to be there. :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-10-30 18:34:44	nbrooks3	I'm in the atrium!
2017-10-31 22:17:27	jmazane1	On challenge 16, the path goes from 8,8 to 9,8 instead of 8,8 to 8,9. Because they both result in the same total cost, are we supposed to favor horizontal moves over vertical moves?
2017-10-31 23:03:50	pbui	No, I've modified the tests to only have one path
2017-10-31 23:03:59	pbui	So don't do anything special
2017-10-31 23:04:19	pbui	The sample does not have a unique path however as you pointed out
2017-10-31 23:40:37	jmazane1	Ok thank you
2017-11-01 01:07:06	dburns3	If you’ve modified the tests to only have one path, where there can be multiple paths, how do we construct the correct path?
2017-11-01 07:02:57	pbui	There can only be one shortest path
2017-11-01 07:03:04	pbui	Is what I meant
2017-11-01 07:03:38	pbui	There shouldn't be two paths with the same cost
2017-11-01 08:57:10	sbrosna1	Could someone check out my challenge16? I am passing both the test case given and the test given from the data structures project but am failing on dredd
2017-11-01 09:01:18	pbui	sbrosna1: you need to clear your map
2017-11-01 09:01:30	pbui	after each iteration
2017-11-01 09:02:44	pbui	err each test case
2017-11-01 09:03:12	pbui	and i need to fix an issue w/ the test cases, b/c u found a path w/ the same cost
2017-11-01 09:03:18	pbui	so let me tweak that in the mean time
2017-11-01 09:11:36	sbrosna1	Thanks
2017-11-01 09:12:07	pbui	ive tweaked the input
2017-11-01 09:12:10	pbui	you should pass now
2017-11-01 09:12:17	pbui	once u fix the clearing issue
2017-11-01 12:01:35	jmcguin1	is there an algorithm I should look at for the longest path catan problem?  I'm having a tough time figuring out how to allow nodes to be visited twice but not edges
2017-11-01 12:03:33	pbui	Traversal, but Mark edges, not vertices
2017-11-01 12:17:14	jmcguin1	ok - also, is the path length the number of edges or number of nodes visited?
2017-11-01 13:37:27	pbui	number of edges
2017-11-01 15:37:17	jmcguin1	hmm I'm struggling to see how the answer would be 12 in the visual example given
2017-11-01 15:47:01	jmcguin1	never mind I'm being dumb I found it

2017-11-01 17:47:22	jmcguin1	is anyone else getting 11 instead of 12 for the second test case of challenge15?  I've heard it's a common problem but I'm not sure if there's an obvious solution
2017-11-01 18:36:37	pbui	other people have, but they corrected it
2017-11-01 18:36:45	pbui	are you tracking edges or nodes?
2017-11-01 18:36:53	pbui	u need to traverse nodes, but mark edges
2017-11-01 18:38:20	jmcguin1	I’m marking edges
2017-11-01 18:46:26	jmcguin1	I use a 2d array to store where I’ve marked, so if I mark the edge from 2-1, then I mark indices [1][2] and [2][1]
2017-11-01 19:04:09	pbui	so what you want to do is for each neighbor: mark the edge w/ neighbor, recurse, unmark
2017-11-01 19:04:19	pbui	each time, track which neighbor gives u the longest path
2017-11-01 19:04:24	pbui	then return the max
2017-11-01 19:08:19	jmcguin1	yeah I was doing it iteratively which I now realize messes up the markings (you can't properly unmark)
2017-11-01 19:13:41	pbui	yep
2017-11-01 19:52:32	ophelan	@channel Hey everyone, unfortunately I'm going to have to cut my office hours short today, if anybody was planning on coming after 8:15 shoot me an email and I can take a look at what you have so far. [cc: ccarball]
2017-11-01 21:28:52	8bit	@ccarball hey how do i do challenges

2017-11-02 01:47:46	araines	for challenge16 how do we know when we reach the end of input?

2017-11-02 13:47:18	phale1	Hey everyone! Office hours in the innovation lab until 4 today!
2017-11-02 14:07:28	hermantong	for challenge15, can we assume the graph is connected?
2017-11-02 14:08:58	phale1	I would assume no
2017-11-02 14:22:44	pbui	no
2017-11-02 19:31:26	jjohns48	Office hours until 9:30!
2017-11-02 21:27:22	jjohns48	I think @kdingens found a another solution for the third input on challenge16. He gets wrong answer but i looked at it and he gets the same weight for a different path than you
2017-11-02 21:27:26	jjohns48	@pbui
2017-11-02 21:29:21	cnailos	also @pbui i think you hid the field for the scores on challenges on sakai when you were fiddling earlier today
2017-11-02 22:08:57	pbui	jjohns48: ok, i will check it out
2017-11-02 22:09:02	pbui	tell him to commit and push
2017-11-02 22:09:04	pbui	and i can tweak it
2017-11-02 22:09:17	jjohns48	Should be pushed already
2017-11-02 22:12:25	pbui	cnailos: fixed
2017-11-02 22:14:42	cnailos	Dope
2017-11-02 22:15:59	pbui	jjohns48: fixed?

2017-11-03 16:05:40	pbui	tlynch2: recursion might be too slow for this
2017-11-03 16:06:04	pbui	also, the way you index/key your data structures is inefficient
2017-11-03 16:06:22	pbui	rather than just concatenating the x and y, use tuples or a class
2017-11-03 16:06:34	pbui	otherwise, it is just very slow
2017-11-03 16:41:47	fritzwill	Im getting an execution error but I cannot for the life of me figure out why... I get the correct result for the trial input and I even added the input numbers in the input file twice just to see if it could handle multiple casses and it has no problem. Is there a way to get more info other than execution error? (ie keyerror with a line number or somethin)

2017-11-04 10:53:45	pbui	what if you have 1, 11 ?
2017-11-04 10:53:56	pbui	you cant distinguish that from 11, 1
2017-11-04 10:54:01	pbui	b/c both would be 111
2017-11-04 10:54:29	pbui	u can either put a token between them, or the proper way is to make a struct for it
2017-11-04 10:54:38	pbui	i ll DM u a quick fix though

2017-11-27 18:03:43	nbrooks3	Also, if you're missing a grade for an assignment from a while back, it may be worth checking that you actually submitted it to the TA for that week.
2017-11-27 18:03:43	nbrooks3	We've seen a number of students not have grades for old assignments and that the respective TA didn't get a submission to grade. Just be careful on that and check sooner rather than later. Thanks!
2017-11-27 18:04:54	nbrooks3	Also, I think I've forgotten to mention I'm AFK for job stuff tonight, so I will not be holding my office hours. However, I can hold more later this week if there's an interest in that!

2017-11-30 12:47:51	nbrooks3	U made a mistake
2017-11-30 14:15:28	phale1	Hey everyone! I have noticed a couple things while grading:
2017-11-30 14:16:11	phale1	1) Please be sure you assigned a TA to your merge requests (preferably the one that is supposed to grade your assignment, but assigning a TA is a good start)
2017-11-30 14:16:52	phale1	2) If a branch is merged but the there is no grade and/or the request is not closed you keep an eye on if it gets graded
2017-11-30 14:17:11	phale1	if it's sitting there and the TA assigned has gotten other grades of yours in alert the TA
2017-11-30 14:18:19	phale1	sometimes mistakes are made or gitlab is funky and we do not see the merge requests or get notified when the assignment is merged, but the request is not closed -- this makes it more difficult for us to find your work
2017-11-30 14:18:35	phale1	this has been a PSA from one of your TA's
2017-11-30 14:18:37	phale1	thank you
2017-11-30 14:33:23	nbrooks3	two, I'm signing my name at the bottom of this, as well
2017-11-30 14:33:37	nbrooks3	We just want yas to get your things graded. c:
2017-11-30 14:44:05	jjohns48	3) Make sure only a single file is present in each merge request. This mistake usually happens if you don't branch off of master. Too often there are merge conflicts because pull requests include files from multiple challenges.
2017-11-30 14:44:41	phale1	^that

2017-12-01 15:01:15	pedrosaunero	Can someone give me a hint of what formula we have to use to get the min volume on Challenge23? I tried the quadratic formula but apparently that doesn’t work
2017-12-01 16:48:21	pbui	pedrosaunero: fold the paper in half
2017-12-01 18:23:01	hermantong	how come the first derivative test only gives the correct maxima but not minima? haven't done calclus since freshman year, this is hard
2017-12-01 18:31:17	pbui	Volume can't be negative
2017-12-01 18:31:39	pbui	The second will give u a min, but it might be a negative Volume
2017-12-01 18:35:38	seiseman	You don't say that length and width > 0, but can we assume that?
2017-12-01 18:49:35	seiseman	you can
2017-12-01 19:18:52	pbui	yes
2017-12-02 11:56:57	aayala4	do we drop our lowest challenge like the sakai grade book says? or no like the course page says?
2017-12-02 12:39:05	pbui	w/e sakai says
2017-12-02 12:39:37	pbui	they both say the same thing
2017-12-02 12:39:47	pbui	b/c we actually have 25 challenges (starting w/ 0)
2017-12-02 12:39:50	pbui	but we only count 24
2017-12-02 12:40:55	aayala4	oh right

2017-12-04 13:03:33	aayala4	for challenge iib, which direction do we prioritize?

2017-12-04 14:30:00	tlynch2	Are we allowed to ask which test case a program is getting an execution error on for the contest?
2017-12-04 14:31:25	pbui	not usually
2017-12-04 14:31:37	pbui	try to figure it out, and if u cant get it wednesday, i ll help you out

2017-12-07 12:02:39	nbrooks3	@channel Please check your gradebooks and understand what is going on there. If everyone waits until the last last minute to bring their grading issues to the class staff and Bui, I imagine that there will be more frustration on everyone's end.
2017-12-07 12:02:39	nbrooks3	My merge requests are up to date, so if you've had me as a grader for one of your assignments and it is not entered, please let me know so we can address it. Thanks. [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-07 12:15:23	phale1	That being said I don't know if all the TA's are up to date with grading. So we appreciate your patience. If you are missing grades and are concerned about it let us know.
2017-12-07 12:22:36	nbrooks3	6
2017-12-07 13:40:56	zjanicki	@channel As of right now, I have graded everything in my merge request pipeline, so if you are missing any grades from me, please email me (zjanicki@nd.edu mailto:zjanicki@nd.edu ) with the name of the ungraded assignment and I will check it out for you [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-07 14:03:25	phale1	I know that it is unlikely anyone will need help but if you do I will be in the basement of la fun working on a group project
2017-12-07 14:05:35	jjohns48	I need help
2017-12-07 14:26:49	pbui	me too
2017-12-07 14:27:08	phale1	I will do your grading for a couple cookies

2017-12-07 14:28:02	phale1	John I will do your grading if you let me throw a snow ball at you with no defenses at point blank range
2017-12-07 14:28:29	jjohns48	Jokes on you, I finished my grading
2017-12-07 14:28:44	phale1	*reassigns all my merge requests to John*
