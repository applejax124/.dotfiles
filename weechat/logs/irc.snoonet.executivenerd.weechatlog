2017-11-12 23:08:44	-->	executivenerd (pi@user/executivenerd) is back on server
2017-11-13 22:36:11	camelot	literally the same main.py i used for the project
2017-11-13 22:36:14	camelot	it doesnt run
2017-11-13 22:37:59	executivenerd	I throws a startup error?
2017-11-13 22:38:12	executivenerd	Do you keep your code on GitLab?
2017-11-13 22:40:10	camelot	i feel stupid
2017-11-13 22:40:19	camelot	http://localhost != localhost
2017-11-13 22:40:49	executivenerd	...
2017-11-13 22:40:54	 *	executivenerd twirls hands
2017-11-13 22:41:09	executivenerd	But seriously, does it work now?
2017-11-13 22:42:19	camelot	server runs
2017-11-13 22:42:28	camelot	now i have to somehow connect it...
2017-11-13 22:47:40	executivenerd	You just request things from the server on your js, you don't need to worry about serving index
2017-11-13 22:50:09	camelot	ok i feel dumb now
2017-11-13 22:50:12	camelot	that makes sense
2017-11-13 22:52:50	executivenerd	No, you're doing it right, it's just that the class is using the student machineQu'est-ce que c'ests to work around
2017-11-13 22:53:36	camelot	dont french at me sir
2017-11-13 22:54:09	executivenerd	Hmmmm... paste buffer... better write a daemon for that
2017-11-13 22:55:15	camelot	no dont add more things to the list
2017-11-13 22:59:48	executivenerd	You realize most services can be written in like 2 hours.
2017-11-13 23:00:00	executivenerd	Also, got Jess to buy in to Hax-mas
2017-11-13 23:00:10	executivenerd	s/Hax/haX
2017-11-13 23:01:57	camelot	omg yes h4xm4s
2017-11-13 23:02:18	camelot	yes but those 2 hours would be better spent either sleeping or jukestaposing
2017-11-13 23:33:02	camelot	do we have to get a different movie every time a vote is put?
2017-11-13 23:36:25	executivenerd	That sounds like a question for the project document.
2017-11-13 23:36:36	executivenerd	Does it list expected behavior?
2017-11-13 23:41:51	camelot	"display a movie recommendation for a given user"
2017-11-13 23:42:50	executivenerd	The piazza also doesn't clarify... I don't feel comfortable telling you to do more or less work, not to give you a bad answer...
2017-11-13 23:43:43	camelot	what did you end up doing?
2017-11-13 23:45:20	executivenerd	I didn't bother modifying it, I confirmed that the vote posts and moved on, sort of like what we did in previous exercies.
2017-11-13 23:47:43	camelot	cool okay that was my plan too
2017-11-13 23:47:49	camelot	thank you for all the help!
2017-11-13 23:49:10	executivenerd	no
2017-11-13 23:50:11	camelot	um?
2017-11-13 23:51:31	executivenerd	sorry, np
2017-11-13 23:52:25	camelot	ok, got scared for a bit there that i said something to piss you off
2017-11-13 23:54:37	executivenerd	When it happens you'll know
2017-11-13 23:55:27	camelot	maybe not
2017-11-13 23:55:33	camelot	i always think everyone's pissed at me
2017-11-13 23:56:06	executivenerd	That's seems like a negative outlook
2017-11-13 23:56:31	camelot	it is
2017-11-13 23:56:48	camelot	i just overthink things
2017-11-13 23:56:56	camelot	and read into things that arent tere
2017-11-13 23:57:07	camelot	and all those things convince me people aare mad at me/hate me
2017-11-13 23:57:29	executivenerd	Well, you just admitted you're making some of your information up, stop doing that.
2017-11-13 23:57:38	executivenerd	And go find a way to figure out for yourself.
2017-11-13 23:59:04	camelot	what can i say? i have an active imagination
2017-11-13 23:59:14	camelot	im working on communication and stuff
2017-11-14 00:00:07	executivenerd	It's a life skill, its not easy. But practice makes perfect, and people grow acustomed to it.
2017-11-14 00:02:25	camelot	how the hell did you get so wise about this crap? you literally always know what to say how do you do it
2017-11-14 00:05:30	executivenerd	I don't know I live life and think about why I do it. It doesn't seem to work that reliably on most of the people I know
2017-11-14 00:08:11	camelot	well you know me and it works on me so just think about that
2017-11-14 21:11:24	camelot	tim went to take a nap around 6ish and still hasnt shown back up to startup. hes gonna be upset if he sleeps too long. i called but no answer. 
2017-11-14 21:12:12	executivenerd	Should I go to Zahm and wake him up?
2017-11-14 21:14:55	camelot	maybe? I dont want to be THAT person, but I also dont want him to be super mad at himself later
2017-11-14 21:32:15	executivenerd	Well, my meeting started, so message me if he shows and I'll try after.
2017-11-14 21:33:39	camelot	okay will do
2017-11-14 22:12:24	camelot	eightbits hasnt shown himself yet
2017-11-14 22:12:28	camelot	i am going to call again
2017-11-14 22:18:52	executivenerd	I'm leaving in 5 minutes, so I'll go get him.
2017-11-14 22:22:54	camelot	okay
2017-11-15 00:09:58	camelot	I didn't actually mean that... Twas merely joke, friend
2017-11-17 00:30:14	executivenerd	This is getting excessive...
2017-11-17 00:32:56	camelot	leave me alone
2017-11-17 00:32:56	--	executivenerd: No such nick/channel
2017-11-17 00:36:22	camelot	leave me alone
2017-11-17 00:39:46	executivenerd	Okay, but I'm not going to do anygood (re: stop doing evil) while I'm clueless.
2017-11-17 00:40:45	camelot	"clueless"
2017-11-17 00:42:47	executivenerd	Do you want to talk about it? Or should I go back to leaving you alone?
2017-11-17 00:44:01	camelot	please don't play dumb with me right now
2017-11-17 00:46:36	executivenerd	I'm seriously confused. I know the past month hasn't gone great, but I have a feeling this is new and I'm really not sure what I did/am doing. How would you like me to prove tat I seriously don't know what you're talking about.
2017-11-17 00:52:40	camelot	Look, I get it. I heard your message loud and clear, so you can stop being such an ass about it.
2017-11-17 00:54:23	executivenerd	Of shit... found the backlog entry... I was talking about Jess specifically. I was trying to agree with your statements to Jess.
2017-11-17 00:55:24	camelot	?
2017-11-17 00:57:06	executivenerd	Sorry, I was looking for what I said to make you angry and the discussion about Jess TA-ing was the first thing I found. Sorry if that's not it. I apparently did something terrible and I can't acknowledge it when I try. Sorry.
2017-11-17 01:00:20	camelot	Are you really this clueless?
2017-11-17 01:02:15	executivenerd	Yes. Have I ever pretended to be this lost? And it's clearly only making you angrier, so why else would I insist on not knowing? I'm clueless? I don't know where to begin talking about this, which means I was doing something careless.
2017-11-17 01:18:40	camelot	Anger is how I deal with pain and getting hurt. Once is fine, but you keep doing it. You can just be such an asshole sometimes. Literally you're telling me I don't count and that I'm nothing and to be honest that doesn't feel great.
2017-11-17 01:24:33	executivenerd	When did I say that? I never remotely meant to say anything like that. I'm sorry to have implied anything else. I fucked up, I wasn't clear, but I don't mean it. I would never mean that. You know I think you matter, don't you? I admit I still don't completely understand, and I'm sorry for that too. But I want to figure this out, b/c I don't want to hurt you anymore, and believe it or not I never
2017-11-17 01:24:35	executivenerd	did.
2017-11-17 01:25:36	executivenerd	You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to. That's fine. I can leave you alone. But I want to stop fucking up liek this because it's patently not okay. I don't want to be like this anymore.
2017-11-17 01:39:12	camelot	You don't say it in as many words. You say it in your self deprecation speeches about being single and all that crap. Cat and I do it too, but when you say things like "no one would ever say that to me" and stuff like that, regardless of what you think or don't think, you are literally telling me that I am shit and I am not even worthy of being considered. Ignore the fact that you don't
2017-11-17 01:39:12	camelot	reciprocate cause like whatever but pretending i dont exist like okay cool thank you just keep shoving the knife back in thanks. and this is super weird to talk about because like this is stupid and dumb but yeah it hurts and thats normal and thats not why I get mad because that's nothing to get mad about. This is really awkward and stupid and basically all I wanted to say was if I really
2017-11-17 01:39:12	camelot	don't count just tell me and like I'll get out of your life entirely thanks.
2017-11-17 01:47:52	executivenerd	Cami... you do count... you're one of the best friends I've ever had. I mean that. I know how you feel and why you feel that way, and I've actually been trying to reign in the single jokes ever since I ran that script. I haven't stopped them all, I'm sure I made up some meta justification that isn't worth typing here, but part of it is keeping the theme of the room (which is stupid) and part of it
2017-11-17 01:47:54	executivenerd	is the simple fact that you wouldn't say it to me either: you're another person I've pushed away. It's not great to hear you make those joke either, nobody likes to see themselves cast as the villan and I can't help how I feel in all of this, but I know I'm not the victim here.
2017-11-17 01:50:04	executivenerd	It's not okay that I say things and you feel bad about them, and that stuff will probably never be okay. I'm sorry I can't do better at this.
2017-11-17 01:50:40	executivenerd	I'm sorry I'm keeping us from moving on.
2017-11-17 01:50:52	executivenerd	I'm sorry I do all of this shit that I don't mean to.
2017-11-17 01:52:01	executivenerd	I don't want you to leave anything, but if my best efforts haven't been enough then maybe it's me who should leave.
2017-11-17 02:02:09	camelot	I'm sorry
2017-11-17 02:08:11	executivenerd	For what?
2017-11-17 02:09:55	camelot	For casting you as the villain.
2017-11-17 02:10:11	executivenerd	Maybe I am...
2017-11-17 02:10:20	executivenerd	How're you feeling?
2017-11-17 02:14:29	camelot	I've been better.
2017-11-17 02:15:22	executivenerd	I'm sorry
2017-11-17 02:19:46	camelot	I have been worse too though so
2017-11-17 02:20:29	executivenerd	Well I'm a perfectionist, I'm disappointed you're not feeling 'best ever'
2017-11-17 02:21:15	camelot	Sorry
2017-11-17 02:22:17	executivenerd	No, it's partially my fault (I meant disappointed in myself)
2017-11-17 02:22:36	executivenerd	s/partially/mostly, or at least muchly
2017-11-17 02:22:53	executivenerd	You don't have anything to apologize for.
2017-11-17 02:24:59	camelot	But it is somely my fault then so sorry for my part
2017-11-17 02:25:51	executivenerd	Will we ever get to a point in the conversation where neither of us feel the need to apologize?
2017-11-17 02:28:24	camelot	Sorry
2017-11-17 02:31:45	executivenerd	It's okay.
2017-11-17 02:32:09	executivenerd	Get some rest Cami. You wanted to get to databases tomorrow, and you need some extra flu-fighting rest.
2017-11-20 14:15:52	camelot	please dont hate me, but would u be willing to share your diggums notes from now? I definitely got more sick since yesterday meh
2017-11-20 14:37:55	executivenerd	Of course, focus on getting better. It's networks today, so you probably already have this down.
2017-11-20 14:43:34	camelot	thanks you're the best
2017-11-20 14:46:18	executivenerd	Check your email. There's an in-class assignment up right now.
2017-11-20 14:46:45	camelot	whats the prompt?
2017-11-20 14:52:32	executivenerd	"Summarize this lesson"
2017-11-20 14:52:57	camelot	i emailed shreya and told her i was dying so i should be okay
2017-11-20 14:52:58	executivenerd	So it's just talking about the network paradigm, the protocols, and maybe mention firewalls.
2017-11-20 14:53:00	camelot	thanks though
2017-11-20 14:53:07	camelot	have fun in probstats
2017-11-20 14:53:16	executivenerd	Oh, then definitely don't pretend you were there.
2017-11-20 14:53:34	camelot	definitely wont
2017-11-20 14:53:43	camelot	thanks for the notes

2017-11-20 15:24:56	camelot	idk how to reformat it like a real project though
2017-11-20 15:26:20	executivenerd	We'll talk about it closer to. I'm happy to have everyone share advice and institute their own rules, but nobody should be hung out to dry. I'll write things up over break and actually post in Lug when we get back.
2017-11-20 15:27:05	camelot	okay sounds perfect
2017-11-20 15:27:10	camelot	im so excited for this

2017-11-28 12:45:36	camelot	I'm sorry. I really don't know why this semester has been so weird. Idk why I'm so behind and not doing work. I'm sorry I'm a terrible group member.

Are you serious? Why do you hate me? Like I thought we were friends but you're always mean and I'm sick of it and I guess I was wrong to think we're friends but whatever cause its not like you ever thought that we were anyway so
2017-11-30 20:45:11	camelot	fine okay I get it
2017-11-30 22:45:15	executivenerd	I'm trying to do a serious thing. If you'd like your name send it attached to the application. Actually, attach it to an email like I asked you to three times.
2017-12-03 11:27:01	camelot	are you alive?
2017-12-03 20:15:10	camelot	accept my invitation

2017-12-03 20:44:07	camelot	nvm
2017-12-03 20:44:16	camelot	i am sleepy
2017-12-03 23:40:49	camelot	wanna get bfast tomorrow before pc? I'm gonna text 8bit, but im pretty sure he passed out
2017-12-03 23:44:15	executivenerd	Sounds lit. If 8bit is asleep now, he'll probs be awake then.
2017-12-03 23:45:05	camelot	yepp yepp
2017-12-03 23:45:09	camelot	i will be as well
2017-12-03 23:45:13	camelot	because i will sleep on the floor
2017-12-03 23:45:22	camelot	because i need to be up and at 'em for pc
2017-12-03 23:45:29	executivenerd	Isn't it killing your back?
2017-12-03 23:46:19	camelot	no, i actually slept there because i thought it would help. 
2017-12-03 23:49:02	executivenerd	they say it does...
2017-12-03 23:49:20	camelot	yeah so im trying it
2017-12-03 23:49:26	camelot	i just hope its not something bad
2017-12-03 23:49:35	camelot	s/bad/serious
2017-12-03 23:50:35	executivenerd	Maybe avoid floor and just stretch 15 min twice a day first?
2017-12-03 23:50:42	executivenerd	The floor might make things worse
2017-12-03 23:50:48	executivenerd	It's a spinal shape thing
2017-12-03 23:51:58	camelot	herp derp
2017-12-03 23:52:12	 *	camelot knows nothing about being health
2017-12-05 00:34:10	executivenerd	Sorry I overlooked your email being the first, I meant to say Francis was the first person I didn't know personally to join, which was validating in its own way. Sorry for saying/implying anything else
2017-12-05 00:52:05	camelot	it's not that. what you said that day, that really hurt. I was not sassing you in that email. You wanted something professional and serious so I was as professional as I possibly could be and its still not enough. I was very hurt and could not view the email I was sending as being one to a friend, because I wasn't sure I had one. I feel like shit when I attack you for stuff, but you hurt me,
2017-12-05 00:52:05	camelot	quite often actually, and I don't know how to react. If I bring it up I feel like you'll just be confused and give me a blanket apology for 'fucking up'. It's just, I really don't know what's going on. I don't know if I'm overreacting or what, but you are like two different people. When its just you and me, or just you me and 8bit, everything's normal and fine and you're just a good friend.
2017-12-05 00:52:05	camelot	But when other people are around for some reason you feel the need to be mean to me. I know it doesn't always seem like you're saying something hurtful, but a lot of times you are. Sometimes your joking "sass" goes a little too far. Idk if you have ever known what its like to be stabbed in the heart by a really close friend, and I really hope you never will if you havent, but that's what you
2017-12-05 00:52:05	camelot	do to me. And I'm not sure how to even begin to tell you this without making you the "villain" of my life. Like you objectively aren't. I like to consider you one of my best friends, but I guess that's why some things hurt that much more. I am so sorry to dump this all on you. I didn't want to, because I have before and I always feel like a bad friend for blaming you for my stupid shitty
2017-12-05 00:52:05	camelot	feelings. I'm sorry for being a bad friend. I'm sorry for being such a horrible person that you feel the need to take out all your anger on me. I'm sorry you have to pretend to be friends with me because of the w31rd0s. I'll just stop typing now.
2017-12-05 00:56:51	executivenerd	Don't be sorry.
2017-12-05 00:57:54	executivenerd	I admit I let myself fly off the handle about the 'sass' in the initial DM's again, which isn't cool. I need to get over that
2017-12-05 00:58:03	executivenerd	You're allowed to be upset.
2017-12-05 00:58:14	executivenerd	But we need to talk about this.
2017-12-05 00:58:36	executivenerd	I'm not acting differently around you, or 8bit, or anyone
2017-12-05 00:59:00	executivenerd	It's the same everywhere. Same rules, same attempts to be okay
2017-12-05 00:59:58	executivenerd	If that's not coming through, then I'm sorry, but I'm a little lost without feedback, and the weekly detonations are clearly not making satisfying progress for anyone.
2017-12-05 01:01:23	executivenerd	Maybe I'm being insensitive. But I feel a double standard. I take my share of shots, and if I shoot back too much I need to check that, 
2017-12-05 01:01:35	executivenerd	But I clearly don't know how.
2017-12-05 01:01:52	executivenerd	I'm not pretending to be friends with you.
2017-12-05 01:02:13	executivenerd	You're one of the coolest people at ND and I count you among my closest friends.
2017-12-05 01:02:28	executivenerd	We're renting a house together
2017-12-05 01:03:09	executivenerd	But if we can't work this out, then maybe that's not a good idea.
2017-12-05 01:03:52	executivenerd	If I really haven't gotten any better, if it really still hurts, if its no longer worth seeing if I can improve, then just cut me loose.
2017-12-05 01:04:27	executivenerd	I have half a dozen 3 person houses for you, Andrew, and 8bit
2017-12-05 01:05:18	executivenerd	And I'm more than happy to leave the w31rd0s alone for the rest of the semester if it would bring you one week of peace
2017-12-05 01:05:57	executivenerd	But know that I do count you as a friend
2017-12-05 01:06:08	executivenerd	I haven't handled it well, but I
2017-12-05 01:06:24	executivenerd	am trying not to do another blanket apology. 
2017-12-05 01:07:23	executivenerd	The dumping isn't a burden, I'd do this twice a day if it would make you feel better, becuse it sucks to think your in pain and it's worse to think that I caused it.
2017-12-05 01:07:57	executivenerd	You're not a horrible person, I would never take my anger out on you.
2017-12-05 01:08:12	executivenerd	Your (terrible) friend,
2017-12-05 01:08:16	executivenerd	-- Doug
2017-12-05 01:20:35	camelot	I'm sorry about the weekly detonations. It's like a bunch of little things just keep piling on top of each other and then there's just that last tiny thing and suddenly i cant hold myself together anymore. You're not being insesitive, maybe you are a double standard, idk. The littlest things seem to hurt 10x more when they come from you and I don't know why and I can't control it and I'm
2017-12-05 01:20:35	camelot	sorry I blame you for my stupid feelings. But yes, sometimes you do shoot back just a little too much and with just the right things and yeah it sucks. I know I shoot at you a lot too and I'm really sorry about that. Sometimes its friendly, most of the times its friendly, but sometimes I'm just trying to defend myself after I feel you've gone a bit too far. That might be the same with you,
2017-12-05 01:20:35	camelot	but I don't know because you never tell me anything. I would never ask you to 'leave the w31rd0s alone', ever. If I feel I need space, you know I take it, but I would never ever ever ask you to leave. I really hate this whole situation because I know you don't mean anything harmful in the slightest with anything you say, because I know you. But at the same time, sometimes it just feels like
2017-12-05 01:20:35	camelot	it. And like I said I can't control how things make me feel and I'm sorry it usually falls on you and I'm sorry I blow up at you and I'm sorry I sass you and don't take your projects seriously. I don't know how to do this friend thing very well and I'm sorry I keep borking it up.
2017-12-05 01:21:46	executivenerd	Me too.
2017-12-05 01:21:53	executivenerd	But we'll figure it out.
2017-12-05 01:22:31	executivenerd	Never stop yelling at me when I deserve it.
2017-12-05 01:29:23	camelot	yelling is bad. yelling is mean. 
2017-12-05 01:29:31	camelot	friends dont yell.
2017-12-05 01:30:59	executivenerd	wasn't FRIENDS DON'T LIE supposed to be yelled very loudly?
2017-12-05 01:32:24	camelot	no, it was whispered very quietly, very politely, and very friendlike
2017-12-05 01:32:56	executivenerd	Oh, okay.
2017-12-05 01:33:18	executivenerd	Are you still planning on meeting Walter tomorrow at 10?
2017-12-05 01:34:26	camelot	I am
2017-12-05 01:35:16	executivenerd	Cool.
2017-12-05 01:35:25	executivenerd	You'll want to get some rest first.
2017-12-05 01:35:36	executivenerd	Will call at 9 to see if you're still alive
2017-12-05 01:39:01	camelot	yes, thank you
2017-12-05 01:39:41	executivenerd	no prob
2017-12-05 14:21:57	camelot	hey can I ask a huge favor?
2017-12-05 14:22:37	executivenerd	What's up?
2017-12-05 14:24:04	camelot	Maru and I got a storage unit together for spring/summer and we kind of need help moving all our stuff there sometime finals week. I know you have a car. Would you be willing to help us out? It definitely should not take too long. 
2017-12-05 14:25:41	executivenerd	When? But sure.
2017-12-05 14:25:59	executivenerd	If I'm not around for all of it, you can at least use my keys for the small stuff.
2017-12-05 14:27:23	camelot	not sure. probably friday or thursday tbh. would that work? i know you have your probstats final friday, right?
2017-12-05 14:28:38	executivenerd	Yes... but I'm also moving out. So it Thurrsday is better, if its all stuff you can go a day without.
2017-12-05 14:32:05	camelot	yeah okay I'll talk to maru. thanks! 
2017-12-05 14:34:56	executivenerd	No prob.
2017-12-06 18:52:25	executivenerd	Could you please text noah something for me? My phone is ded.
2017-12-06 18:52:43	camelot	sure whats the message
2017-12-06 18:53:21	executivenerd	Tell him that the AppClub meeting is at 8:00 PM in DeBart 207

2017-12-07 10:25:14	camelot	did you get any sleep last night?
2017-12-07 10:39:24	executivenerd	It's fair to say that I wasn't restless
2017-12-07 10:48:51	camelot	please get some sleep
2017-12-07 13:31:22	executivenerd	When I'm done working

2017-12-07 19:37:40	executivenerd	I don't get a choice? Seems unfair.

2017-12-07 19:39:31	executivenerd	I have eaten. I need to submit vision before midnight.

2017-12-07 19:55:19	executivenerd	I'm fine.
2017-12-07 19:55:50	executivenerd	In 4 hours it won't matter either way, I just want to spend that time finishing the semester the best I can.
2017-12-07 19:58:44	camelot	that's fine. im still bringing you food. you can type and eat a sandwich at the same time. where are you
2017-12-07 19:59:25	camelot	tim and i will scour the campus looking for you if you don't tell us
2017-12-07 20:03:02	camelot	tim will hold the damn sandwich to your mouth while you type
2017-12-07 20:03:11	executivenerd	You really shouldn't.

2017-12-08 00:15:20	camelot	we're trying to find you
2017-12-08 16:01:17	<--	executivenerd (pi@user/executivenerd) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.6)
2017-12-08 22:58:16	-->	executivenerd (doug@user/executivenerd) is back on server
2017-12-09 00:17:04	camelot	i found out who medea is
2017-12-09 00:32:25	executivenerd	I mean, congrats, you've worked hard for the info, but you decided I needed to know that? Right now? 
2017-12-09 00:32:35	executivenerd	I don't wanna know who medea is.
2017-12-09 00:32:40	executivenerd	But good sleuthing
2017-12-09 00:32:44	camelot	i'm sorry?
2017-12-09 00:32:46	executivenerd	Did they tell you?
2017-12-09 00:32:52	camelot	did i offfend you in some way?
2017-12-09 00:32:56	executivenerd	Nope
2017-12-09 00:33:00	executivenerd	Sorry
2017-12-09 00:33:09	camelot	yeah she just told me
2017-12-09 00:33:17	camelot	and i have some questions for you about that
2017-12-09 00:33:20	camelot	actually
2017-12-09 00:33:27	executivenerd	Wait, she didn't even make you guess?
2017-12-09 00:33:30	camelot	no
2017-12-09 00:33:37	executivenerd	What kind of questions?
2017-12-09 00:33:55	camelot	jess is medea
2017-12-09 00:34:00	camelot	akk is in love with medea
2017-12-09 00:34:04	camelot	she doesnt know what to do
2017-12-09 00:34:38	executivenerd	Okay, breaking the rule of not knowing medea for the emergency of resolving a thing.
2017-12-09 00:34:49	executivenerd	And now focusing on problem instead of procedurals...
2017-12-09 00:34:57	executivenerd	Is AKK actually in love w/ medea?
2017-12-09 00:35:04	executivenerd	They've never met
2017-12-09 00:35:37	executivenerd	Or does he just say stuff as part of a huge inside joke.
2017-12-09 00:36:02	executivenerd	There's always been a nonzero probability it ws someone AKK already knew.
2017-12-09 00:36:32	camelot	no like he dms her and hes opened up to her a lot and hes told her like how hes been catfished by other girls before and stuff and how hes just so happy he can talk to medea and that they have so much in common
2017-12-09 00:36:38	camelot	well yes of course
2017-12-09 00:36:54	camelot	maybe not in love in love but like definitely feels
2017-12-09 00:37:44	camelot	and there are only three options: either jess tells him its her and he pines for her, medea disappears froever and he pines for the perfect girl, or jess tells him its her and hes disappointed and sad 
2017-12-09 00:37:48	camelot	they're all bad
2017-12-09 00:38:03	executivenerd	Well I'm not parsing the message, but you can open up to friends to. If you don't encourage him, AKK should slide into the friend zone and acept some boundaries.
2017-12-09 00:38:43	executivenerd	You don't have feels for a person you know you're not compatible with.
2017-12-09 00:39:30	executivenerd	Disapperaing definitely falls under catfishing
2017-12-09 00:39:58	executivenerd	If/when AKK finds out, he'll either like him or not.
2017-12-09 00:40:18	executivenerd	And from there its like dealing with any friend that likes you.
2017-12-09 00:40:28	executivenerd	Wait, why am I giving advice?
2017-12-09 00:42:21	camelot	because you give good advice
2017-12-09 00:44:11	executivenerd	Not quite true.
2017-12-09 00:44:25	executivenerd	Also, why is Jess not asking me?
2017-12-09 00:44:36	executivenerd	Did you tell me something she doesn't want me to know?
2017-12-09 00:44:47	camelot	No she said I could tell you
2017-12-09 00:44:54	camelot	idk
2017-12-09 00:44:57	camelot	sorry
2017-12-09 00:48:26	executivenerd	no problem
2017-12-09 00:48:39	executivenerd	I shuold have known you wouldn't betray her trust
2017-12-09 00:49:17	executivenerd	But yeah, it's just like any other curve
2017-12-09 00:50:35	camelot	she just feels bad
2017-12-09 00:50:57	camelot	she doesnt want him to pine or be sad and its just there's really no way out of it
2017-12-09 00:52:25	executivenerd	It isn't like she can help people liking her.
2017-12-09 00:57:10	camelot	true she's so likeable
2017-12-09 01:02:25	camelot	hey do you know if i did something to upset tim?
2017-12-09 01:03:06	executivenerd	Hm? Oh, b/c he left early?
2017-12-09 01:03:21	executivenerd	I really thought he was just trying to sleep before AOC
2017-12-09 01:03:33	executivenerd	Or just sleep and get up early.
2017-12-09 01:03:45	executivenerd	It is readings days.
2017-12-09 01:05:39	camelot	yeah i guess..
2017-12-09 01:05:39	camelot	idk
2017-12-09 01:05:53	camelot	it just seemed like he left right after i asked him for help on aoc
2017-12-09 01:06:02	camelot	and then took my laptop back
2017-12-09 01:07:51	executivenerd	The boy needs more christmas movies.
2017-12-09 01:08:26	executivenerd	And he usually likes self deprecating discussions less than the rest of us. Were we having one of those?
2017-12-09 01:08:36	executivenerd	I wouldn't worry to much about it.
2017-12-09 01:08:44	camelot	he called my code dissgusting
2017-12-09 01:08:51	camelot	then i said "i know i am"
2017-12-09 01:08:54	camelot	and he got up and left
2017-12-09 01:09:00	camelot	idk
2017-12-09 01:09:04	executivenerd	hmmm....
2017-12-09 01:09:06	camelot	he seemed really upset
2017-12-09 01:09:13	executivenerd	I wouldn't try to read into it
2017-12-09 01:09:17	camelot	why do i always fuck things up?
2017-12-09 01:09:23	camelot	idk how to people
2017-12-09 01:09:24	executivenerd	You don't
2017-12-09 01:09:27	camelot	or friend
2017-12-09 01:09:31	camelot	i always mess things up
2017-12-09 01:10:31	executivenerd	Talk to him tomorrow, don't pick at it. Give him an opportunity to say what's on his mind, and let him talk to you
2017-12-09 01:10:49	executivenerd	If he doesn't then, there's literally nothing you can do.
2017-12-09 01:12:11	camelot	ok
2017-12-09 01:12:51	camelot	hey you would tell me if you were upset with me, right? 
2017-12-09 01:13:02	executivenerd	Yep
2017-12-09 01:13:07	executivenerd	I have in the past
2017-12-09 01:13:20	executivenerd	It's what friends do.
2017-12-09 01:13:28	executivenerd	b/c that's how friends work things out
2017-12-09 01:14:17	camelot	im sorry about throwing snow in your face
2017-12-09 01:14:20	camelot	and poking your nose
2017-12-09 01:15:07	executivenerd	It's fine
2017-12-09 01:15:13	executivenerd	You're fine
2017-12-09 01:16:25	camelot	am I? I feel like I'm always doing stupid shit and bothering you and you're just putting up with me and idky
2017-12-09 01:16:37	camelot	and im sorry for all the stupid shit i do
2017-12-09 01:16:53	camelot	im sorry for being a shitty person
2017-12-09 01:16:58	executivenerd	You're fine
2017-12-09 01:17:39	executivenerd	You shouldn't feel weird about being you.
2017-12-09 01:19:27	camelot	shouldn't I though if its bothering everyone?
2017-12-09 01:21:17	executivenerd	Well, if you don't want to bother people, then you need to change your behavior so you don't think you're bothering people. But that is still you and how much you want to change b/c of what you think of something else is still up to you.
