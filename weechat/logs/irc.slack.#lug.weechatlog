2017-10-19 04:14:07	noah.y	for those who have reddit accounts and are not lurkers like me, is there a feature which 'saves' top posts from subreddits you are subscribed to over a period of time and shows them to you? like say I was afk for a day, I could set it to show me all the posts in a subreddit exceeding x score or something during that day
2017-10-19 04:15:47	noah.y	if not I call firstsies on the idea
2017-10-19 04:19:05	8bit	top
2017-10-19 04:19:05	8bit	is the feature
2017-10-19 04:21:10	8bit	Like you can do top (of day) (of week) ( of month) (of all time) or something like that
2017-10-19 01:12:53	noah.y	Hmm ok I guess that’s kinda like it huh

2017-10-19 08:32:42	flynn	@walter.scheirer @tweninger The digital humanities backlash continues in the Chronicle: http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-University-Is-Not-a/241471 
2017-10-19 08:35:40	walter.scheirer	the point of DH isn't to "fix the humanities"
2017-10-19 08:35:55	walter.scheirer	it's to provide new criticisms to complement existing ones
2017-10-19 08:37:29	walter.scheirer	as well as digital infrastructure to support traditional scholarship
2017-10-19 08:37:38	walter.scheirer	the pushback is not new
2017-10-19 08:38:13	walter.scheirer	the times ran a rather angry anti-DH op-ed by stanley fish a few years ago
2017-10-19 08:38:48	flynn	It's quite ironic to see academic tail-chasing like this. Subfields criticizing each others' scholarship...
2017-10-19 08:39:34	flynn	Especially in areas like the humanities that face what amounts to an existential threat

2017-10-19 09:15:33	dchiang	These people don't even know what digital humanities is -- they seem to think it's about algorithms for measuring the impact of a paper
2017-10-19 09:15:56	dchiang	Or maybe that idea comes from the paper they're criticizing, which is paywalled
2017-10-19 09:45:32	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-10-19 09:45:42	walter.scheirer	the chronicle itself is also paywalled

2017-10-19 10:28:55	8bit	Any idea why `umount` might say something isn't mounted, and `lsblk` would disagree?
2017-10-19 10:37:13	pbui	not sure @8bit
2017-10-19 10:37:24	8bit	sad
2017-10-19 10:45:30	8bit	looks like an fstab issue...
2017-10-19 10:45:46	pbui	sounds about right
2017-10-19 10:46:03	8bit	wrong options or someting
2017-10-19 10:47:39	8bit	Yeah if I just do a normal mount it works so I'll just fix it later
2017-10-19 11:47:57	pbui	Also, I am planning to rent an apartment fro you from Sunday, May 20,
2017-10-19 11:47:59	pbui	through Sunday, July 1.  Orientation is Tuesday, May 22.  (Note ND
2017-10-19 11:48:01	pbui	graduation is Sunday, May 20.  If you intend to go, I recommend you fly to
2017-10-19 11:48:03	pbui	Rome right after graduation -- the same day).
2017-10-19 11:48:08	pbui	@jcioffi: ^ looks like i wont miss graduation
2017-10-19 11:48:15	pbui	i just need to leave right after it
2017-10-19 12:10:32	jcioffi	! You'll stay??
2017-10-19 12:11:10	ccarball	I'm coming for graduation
2017-10-19 12:12:46	jcioffi	I know :)
2017-10-19 12:13:43	jeffrey	What's with rome?
2017-10-19 12:14:12	jeffrey	Also tfw you're at umass and you're already on the internet

2017-10-19 14:16:36	androidkitkat	:smile:
2017-10-19 14:16:49	pbui	it's what i put on my wife and children's computers
2017-10-19 14:17:42	wtheisen	yeah I like the xfce4 terminal, just wish it had italics
2017-10-19 14:17:59	pbui	usc tix on sale
2017-10-19 14:18:04	pbui	wtheisen: it doesnt?
2017-10-19 14:18:11	pbui	i use rxvt-unicode
2017-10-19 14:18:35	wtheisen	not natively i don’t think. it has bold but not italics
2017-10-19 14:18:48	pbui	i dont think id ever use italics in a terminal
2017-10-19 14:18:52	pbui	but that's just me
2017-10-19 14:18:52	wtheisen	i tried urxvt or whatever it was but my beard wasn’t grey enough
2017-10-19 14:18:56	pbui	...
2017-10-19 14:18:59	walter.scheirer	i delayed my trip to Venice for ICCV so I could see the game
2017-10-19 14:19:16	wtheisen	that’s true dedication
2017-10-19 14:19:19	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-10-19 14:19:20	pbui	xfce4-terminal is my fallback, but i use urxvt
2017-10-19 14:20:44	wtheisen	I remember having a ton of trouble with my like triple-patched font with urxvt
2017-10-19 14:21:02	pbui	well, see, u are ricing hard af
2017-10-19 14:21:07	pbui	i just use a single font
2017-10-19 14:21:33	pbui	i dont like that the vte terminals seem blurrier
2017-10-19 14:21:38	pbui	i like the crispness of my bitmap fonts
2017-10-19 14:22:21	wtheisen	is there a good beginners guide to learn all about that font stuff? like kearning and what not? 4chan always harps about it
2017-10-19 14:23:22	wtheisen	what font do u use pbui?
2017-10-19 14:24:33	pbui	tamzen

2017-10-19 19:02:30	dchiang	@walter.scheirer yeah I was a little surprised by this
2017-10-19 19:02:56	dchiang	But they did an extensive survey and discussions and there is a pretty strong segment that is suspicious of arxiv
2017-10-19 19:08:55	dchiang	Maybe there is more sensitivity to reviewer bias in our community
2017-10-19 19:20:32	8bit	backlog got added to weechat??
2017-10-19 19:22:54	androidkitkat	Well I put my SIM into an Android phone
2017-10-19 19:59:15	walter.scheirer	interesting...
2017-10-19 19:59:35	walter.scheirer	the use of arxiv is fairly uncontroversial in vision
2017-10-19 20:04:50	wtheisen	why in god’s name is lafun closed, I had to freaking grubhub feelsbadman
2017-10-19 20:20:50	pbui	wtheisen: Eddy St?
2017-10-19 20:21:23	wtheisen	oh yeah, I always forget that’s a thing shoot
2017-10-19 20:21:31	wtheisen	i’ll do that tomorrow
2017-10-19 20:26:57	pbui	Could have limebiked to Chipotle or five guys or even the overlook
2017-10-19 20:37:27	8bit	grubhub is so expensive
2017-10-19 20:37:36	8bit	unless I just did it wrong when I used it once last year
2017-10-19 20:59:16	walter.scheirer	lots of peolpe on eddy st. tonight
2017-10-19 21:07:37	pbui	University of Chicago Graduate Students Vote to Unionize - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15512066 
2017-10-19 21:07:58	pbui	walter.scheirer: ^ will this ever come to ND?
2017-10-19 21:08:43	walter.scheirer	i doubt it, grad students here don't face the same economic pressure as their peers in big cities
2017-10-19 21:09:11	walter.scheirer	this has come up a bit on conversations over the past couple years, and i don't sense any enthusiasm
2017-10-19 21:14:54	pbui	Also, ND is conservative
2017-10-19 21:15:01	pbui	Don't rock the boat
2017-10-19 21:18:10	walter.scheirer	i think a lot of students don't realize where the money comes from
2017-10-19 21:18:44	walter.scheirer	for science and engineering, PIs may be forced to react by shrinking their labs
2017-10-19 21:20:26	walter.scheirer	somebody should really re-think the whole grad student / post-doc game
2017-10-19 21:20:35	walter.scheirer	and formulate sensible policies
2017-10-19 21:54:51	tweninger	I'm not so sure Walter, an extra thousand or two a month wouldn't effect my budget much.
2017-10-19 21:54:51	tweninger	Ultimately it's not up to us, it's up to the students to organize if they feel it is warranted. It may be foolish though to ask for a 20$ raise to pay 20$ in union dues.
2017-10-19 22:01:09	walter.scheirer	what's difficult to understand is the dynamics for students in a union
2017-10-19 22:01:37	walter.scheirer	if they go on strike, can profs. simply dismiss them from the program?
2017-10-19 22:01:53	walter.scheirer	give them poor grades for not turning in work
2017-10-19 22:01:53	walter.scheirer	etc.
2017-10-19 22:06:27	tweninger	I understand that we can dismiss students at anytime for any reason... But we choose to follow a sensible, academic policy (as we should)
2017-10-19 22:06:28	tweninger	Failure to show up to work (stroke or not) would result in a PhD student's dismissal
2017-10-19 22:07:30	tweninger	But I am not a lawyer, there exist labor laws and union laws that I don't know about
2017-10-19 22:07:49	walter.scheirer	but that's where it gets messy --- this is school
2017-10-19 22:07:57	walter.scheirer	not a typical job scenaio
2017-10-19 22:07:58	tweninger	Is there a staff union here?
2017-10-19 22:10:24	tweninger	Illinois graduate student Union striked once when I was a student. I was on fellowship so it didn't apply to me. The nlrb mediated and grad students get many concessions
2017-10-19 22:10:29	tweninger	Got*
2017-10-19 22:18:14	walter.scheirer	major grievances usually relate to teaching duties in humanities departments
2017-10-19 22:18:32	walter.scheirer	where there is often legitimate  labor exploitation
2017-10-19 22:29:25	tweninger	Right, at Illinois the CS students didn't have any complaints but didn't cross the picked line or if solidarity
2017-10-19 22:35:40	pbui	I don't think there is a staff Union at ND
2017-10-19 22:35:59	walter.scheirer	ND is a rather good employer, even for low-level staff
2017-10-19 22:36:38	pbui	Depends on the position, but I mostly agree
2017-10-19 22:37:02	pbui	Nd has really good benefits
2017-10-19 22:37:29	pbui	So even if the wages are not great, people stick around for that
2017-10-19 22:38:09	pbui	That said, ND is very top down and doesn't really seem to have shared governance
2017-10-19 22:38:31	pbui	Which is not a big deal to most people, but is to some
2017-10-19 22:38:59	tweninger	Yeah, the dean have chatted about that a bit recently, faculty Senate is a big deal at most places.
2017-10-19 22:40:07	tweninger	We are a school in the Catholic tradition right. :)
2017-10-19 22:40:21	pbui	Basically
2017-10-19 22:40:52	tweninger	By that I mean is not a democracy
2017-10-19 22:40:58	walter.scheirer	ND runs rather smoothly compared to other schools i've been at
2017-10-19 22:41:14	walter.scheirer	i'm not sure we need or actually want a more powerful faculty senate
2017-10-19 22:41:24	tweninger	This is also very true. ND runs like a Swiss watch
2017-10-19 22:41:53	pbui	I think that's why most people don't care about shared governance at nd
2017-10-19 22:42:17	tweninger	I don't know what we'd gain from a powerful Senate though
2017-10-19 22:42:41	walter.scheirer	dysfunction
2017-10-19 22:42:59	tweninger	Yes
2017-10-19 22:43:13	pbui	That's democracy for you
2017-10-19 22:44:16	tweninger	As a non tenured assistant professor I have no opinion on the matter
2017-10-19 22:45:59	pbui	as a never-ever-gonna-get-tenure professor, i have opinions, but will keep quiet
2017-10-19 22:46:02	pbui	:]
2017-10-19 22:46:46	pbui	actually, i think the idea behind shared governance is to have a say in the direction of the school, at least when it comes to academic matters
2017-10-19 22:46:59	pbui	such as curriculum, admissions, and hiring
2017-10-19 22:47:23	walter.scheirer	the university does have committees for those things
2017-10-19 22:47:32	walter.scheirer	that span across colleges
2017-10-19 22:47:36	pbui	but the admin doesnt have to listen to those committees
2017-10-19 22:47:40	pbui	they are toothless
2017-10-19 22:47:45	walter.scheirer	harsh
2017-10-19 22:48:18	pbui	at other schools, the chancellor or president could not implement a new agenda w/out faculty senate
2017-10-19 22:48:29	pbui	that was the case at uwec
2017-10-19 22:48:34	pbui	and i see both sides of it
2017-10-19 22:48:47	pbui	at uwec things were dysfunctional and move slowly
2017-10-19 22:48:59	pbui	but at least people got there say and were invested
2017-10-19 22:49:03	pbui	their*
2017-10-19 22:49:14	pbui	at nd, things move fast and are pretty smooth
2017-10-19 22:49:25	pbui	but they are ordained, there is little buy in
2017-10-19 22:49:58	pbui	for instance, take the core curriculum, uwec spent years debating (way too long) and it was still a mess when i left, but we all had a say
2017-10-19 22:50:07	pbui	i participated and advocated for various things
2017-10-19 22:50:21	pbui	w/ the core curriculum, i feel like most people dont even care
2017-10-19 22:50:32	walter.scheirer	because it seems to be fine
2017-10-19 22:50:33	pbui	just like w/e tell us the new rules and we ll move on
2017-10-19 22:51:08	pbui	it probably is
2017-10-19 22:51:16	pbui	i just hope CS gets to count for something :]
2017-10-19 22:51:33	tweninger	Well, we'd complain if there was a problem. But the curriculum committee was faculty led and implemented with lots of faculty input.
2017-10-19 22:52:49	tweninger	I don't think there is much anxiety in campus about governance. Administration can't fill roles as it is
2017-10-19 22:53:19	pbui	as long as we are governed well, i dont think people have a problem...
2017-10-19 22:53:30	pbui	but when we are not...
2017-10-19 22:54:11	walter.scheirer	i'm not sure i want the faculty senate trying to save us
2017-10-19 22:54:23	tweninger	^^
2017-10-19 22:54:25	pbui	visions of jar jar binks...
2017-10-19 22:54:54	pbui	i also think there is a field bias though
2017-10-19 22:55:10	pbui	like for engineering and science, we tend to just want to be left alone
2017-10-19 22:55:32	pbui	while the humanities are much more interested in this sort of collaborative process
2017-10-19 22:56:18	pbui	for the humanities, their lack of prestige and resources makes their desire for a bigger say in governing that much more pronounced
2017-10-19 22:57:02	walter.scheirer	though not as much a problem at ND, where the humanities have great resources

2017-10-20 08:35:16	flynn	in the voidlinux article linked above: "The system is only using 33 MB of RAM. Incredible!"
2017-10-20 08:37:55	flynn	I realize this is an "old guy yells at clouds" posting, but I remember when a nice full featured linux system ran *comfortably* in 32MB of disk. And perhaps 4MB of RAM....
2017-10-20 08:40:14	flynn	Of course that was in 1994 or so. Slackware required several dozen floppies to install. And I think that 32MB/4MB was for a system without X
2017-10-20 08:40:37	pbui	alpine linux fits in about 5 MB
2017-10-20 08:40:44	pbui	but it uses busybox as its userland
2017-10-20 08:41:20	flynn	Is "damn small linux" still around? Busybox was a work of genius. Basically made embedded linux possible
2017-10-20 08:41:22	pbui	i use alpine linux for some of my docker containers and it makes them very lightweight compared to say ubuntu
2017-10-20 08:41:43	pbui	yes, i think dsl is still around, but it hasnt been updated in a while
2017-10-20 08:41:49	pbui	i think there is now tiny core linux

2017-10-20 09:38:53	jcioffi	woo heading back to campus
2017-10-20 09:41:23	pbui	good, we need more ND fans to fight the usc tide
2017-10-20 09:57:42	bdevorem	@pbui do you know where the log file is for wpa cli or wpa supplicant
2017-10-20 09:58:03	pbui	on arch?
2017-10-20 09:58:12	bdevorem	Yeah
2017-10-20 09:58:16	pbui	journalctl -u wpa_supplicant
2017-10-20 09:58:22	bdevorem	Nice thx
2017-10-20 09:58:23	pbui	if u used systemd
2017-10-20 09:59:54	bdevorem	Have you ever seen the problem where wpa cli sees a network and says ok to connecting to it, but just doesnt connect?
2017-10-20 10:00:11	pbui	could be a dhcp problem
2017-10-20 10:00:17	bdevorem	ugh
2017-10-20 10:00:36	pbui	wpa just authenticates
2017-10-20 10:00:48	pbui	but dhcpcd or networkd establishes the ip address
2017-10-20 10:00:56	pbui	so maybe look at those log files
2017-10-20 10:02:05	bdevorem	Do u know where those are located off the top of ur head?
2017-10-20 10:02:22	pbui	everything is in the systemd journal
2017-10-20 10:02:29	bdevorem	ok
2017-10-20 10:02:30	pbui	so journalctl -u unit-name
2017-10-20 10:02:39	pbui	try journalctl -u dhcpcd
2017-10-20 10:02:45	bdevorem	ok
2017-10-20 10:02:46	pbui	try journalctl -u systemd-networkd
2017-10-20 10:02:55	pbui	i dont know what u use, but it's something like that
2017-10-20 10:03:05	bdevorem	thx
2017-10-20 10:03:15	pbui	let us know which one it is
2017-10-20 10:03:17	pbui	for the record
2017-10-20 10:03:19	pbui	:]
2017-10-20 10:03:38	bdevorem	will do
2017-10-20 10:06:40	pbui	@jeffrey: @wtheisen http://www.instructables.com/id/IronForge-the-NetBSD-Toaster/ 
2017-10-20 10:06:57	jeffrey	Yay
2017-10-20 10:08:29	bdevorem	those worked pbui, dhcpcd has no logs tho
2017-10-20 10:08:54	bdevorem	also networkd has nothing helpful
2017-10-20 10:11:08	pbui	dhcpcd might not have any logs b/c i think u use networkd
2017-10-20 10:11:08	pbui	iirc
2017-10-20 10:11:19	pbui	can u share a snapshot of the log for wpa_supplicant and systemd-networkd?
2017-10-20 10:13:06	bdevorem	yeah, no internet so gonna be a cellphone pic
2017-10-20 10:15:06	pbui	ok

2017-10-20 10:16:07	bdevorem	I rebooted twice as you can see
2017-10-20 10:17:02	pbui	those logs say nothing
2017-10-20 10:17:04	pbui	lol
2017-10-20 10:17:12	bdevorem	ikr
2017-10-20 10:17:15	pbui	run `wpa_cli`
2017-10-20 10:17:19	pbui	what does it report
2017-10-20 10:17:21	bdevorem	Is running
2017-10-20 10:17:47	bdevorem	doesnt say anything out of the ordinary
2017-10-20 10:18:14	bdevorem	Let me add the network, said ok, add the psk, said ok, connect/enable, said ok, and now says its my current network
2017-10-20 10:18:36	bdevorem	But i3bar doesnt show its connected and no internet
2017-10-20 10:18:41	pbui	after u do that, restart networkd
2017-10-20 10:18:55	pbui	systemctl restart systemd-networkd
2017-10-20 10:19:17	pbui	or add the network by appending it to ur .conf
2017-10-20 10:19:25	pbui	your wpa_supplicant.conf
2017-10-20 10:19:28	pbui	and restart both daemons
2017-10-20 10:20:34	bdevorem	says failed to restart, interactive auth required
2017-10-20 10:20:49	bdevorem	And the network is in my conf, always has been
2017-10-20 10:21:03	bdevorem	Didnt connect with that so i tried wpa cli
2017-10-20 10:21:55	bdevorem	when i do `systemctl status networkd-systemd` it says the service cant be found
2017-10-20 10:24:39	pbui	should be systemd-networkd
2017-10-20 10:24:45	pbui	does `dmesg` offer any hints
2017-10-20 10:24:50	pbui	maybe it's a wireless driver problem
2017-10-20 10:27:21	pbui	so this sounds like it was working previously, but not today
2017-10-20 10:32:53	bdevorem	Let me look, and yes it worked previously
2017-10-20 10:33:53	bdevorem	what should i be looking for with dmesg
2017-10-20 10:34:12	pbui	anything about your wireless card
2017-10-20 10:34:18	pbui	or the network
2017-10-20 10:37:01	bdevorem	Ok, i have a talk i need to go to but ill do this after
2017-10-20 10:37:05	bdevorem	Thanks for the help pbui
2017-10-20 10:38:29	pbui	gl
2017-10-20 10:40:38	pbui	tfw when i add "slacking and hacking" to my CV as an invited talk
2017-10-20 10:40:44	pbui	padding those stats
2017-10-20 10:55:48	jeffrey	Talking about linux is off topic
2017-10-20 10:56:14	pbui	i blame the president emeritus

2017-10-20 11:07:49	pbui	now they lost me
2017-10-20 11:07:52	pbui	so unrealistic :p
2017-10-20 11:37:03	catvajiac	he's also been seen using both nano and vim
2017-10-20 12:22:22	jbaker10	What is vim?
2017-10-20 12:43:46	pbui	i did it, i wrote my professional statement
2017-10-20 12:45:40	pbui	lug makes a cameo: "My passion for computer science in general and open source in particular has lead me to revive the Notre Dame Linux Users Group. I currently serve as the faculty advisor for the student organization and work to encourage an inclusive and welcoming community to all computing enthusiasts regardless of their preference in distribution, text editor, window manager, or shell."
2017-10-20 12:47:45	tweninger	Tabs or spaces?
2017-10-20 12:47:53	pbui	spaces
2017-10-20 12:47:56	wtheisen	spaces
2017-10-20 12:50:30	tweninger	I forgot to tell you to put that on your CV bui
2017-10-20 12:54:48	ccarball	spaces
2017-10-20 12:59:38	tweninger	#teachthecontroversy
2017-10-20 12:59:53	pbui	i did it, i finished reapplying for my job
2017-10-20 13:00:04	ccarball	tweninger: please tell me you're spaces
2017-10-20 13:00:40	tweninger	I don't have to defend myself to you undergraduates! :smile:
2017-10-20 13:01:15	pbui	tweninger: uses php and java
2017-10-20 13:01:18	pbui	let that sink in
2017-10-20 13:01:20	tweninger	but really.. I don't program much anymore, when I do I translate the tab command to 4-spaces.
2017-10-20 13:01:50	tweninger	...in python
2017-10-20 13:01:55	pbui	right, that's still spaces
2017-10-20 13:02:02	pbui	it's about what u store in the file
2017-10-20 13:02:06	pbui	everyone uses the tab key
2017-10-20 13:02:42	ccarball	"java--" -pbui
2017-10-20 13:02:56	ccarball	from that one time i did a challenge in java
2017-10-20 13:02:58	pbui	isnt that just c++?
2017-10-20 13:03:00	tweninger	can we all agree that various forms of whitespace have no place in a PL grammar?
2017-10-20 13:03:09	tweninger	thats the worse design feature of python
2017-10-20 13:03:16	pbui	no wai
2017-10-20 13:03:19	walter.scheirer	???
2017-10-20 13:03:51	pbui	tim is hating on forced whitespace/indents
2017-10-20 13:04:04	ccarball	...
2017-10-20 13:04:20	pbui	i left out choice in whitespace in my professional statement for a reason
2017-10-20 13:04:25	tweninger	and I stand by it. Whitespace style ought to be a convention (vigorously enforced) but not part of the grammar
2017-10-20 13:04:29	pbui	somethings u just need to draw a line
2017-10-20 13:04:56	walter.scheirer	http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/rand-paul-takes-poke-us-peer-review-panels 
2017-10-20 13:04:59	pbui	what's interesting is golang forces tabs and everyone has to use their gofmt tool
2017-10-20 13:05:09	pbui	and most people are ok w/ that
2017-10-20 13:06:02	ccarball	pbui: "you trying to start a war, tim?" tweninger: "I got nothing to do today"
2017-10-20 13:06:12	ccarball	who's the real troll

2017-10-20 13:30:51	flynn	naaah what am i thinking

2017-10-20 14:29:02	walter.scheirer	I was really getting into this, voice shaking. (Yes, I know, I'm a terrible human being.)
2017-10-20 14:31:01	jeffrey	White space is also part of the c grammar
2017-10-20 14:31:53	pbui	oh?
2017-10-20 14:32:04	jeffrey	For #include
2017-10-20 14:33:06	jeffrey	So I guess it's just part of the c preprocessor grammar
2017-10-20 14:34:42	pbui	do u handle that in compilers?
2017-10-20 14:34:50	jeffrey	Nope
2017-10-20 14:35:40	jeffrey	Oh, and c++ style comments
2017-10-20 14:36:35	jeffrey	Personally I would like a language with no forced newlines
2017-10-20 14:38:16	pbui	javascript?
2017-10-20 14:38:24	pbui	that's what the minimizers do
2017-10-20 14:38:29	pbui	just take out all whitespace
2017-10-20 14:45:07	jeffrey	Well and rename stuff
2017-10-20 14:45:32	pbui	yes
2017-10-20 14:45:34	pbui	that's true
2017-10-20 14:46:48	jeffrey	JavaScript still has the c++ style comment though. I guess minimizes also remove comments.
2017-10-20 14:46:58	jeffrey	Down with //
2017-10-20 14:47:18	jeffrey	. /**/ for life
2017-10-20 14:47:28	jeffrey	The dot was so slack would let me send it.
2017-10-20 15:46:28	jeffrey	wait is today jess's birthday?
2017-10-20 15:53:48	pbui	that's the word on the street
2017-10-20 15:54:39	jeffrey	so she's old now
2017-10-20 15:55:19	jeffrey	wait I haven't seen conrad in lug for a while
2017-10-20 15:55:36	jeffrey	now I just gotta get rid of happy, so I can be the oldest lug student member
2017-10-20 15:57:18	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-10-20 15:57:40	walter.scheirer	what if i enroll for my free faculty credits?
2017-10-20 15:57:54	walter.scheirer	that would give me student status
2017-10-20 15:58:14	jeffrey	I'll change it to "oldest non-degree-holding lug member"
2017-10-20 15:58:18	jeffrey	that also solves the happy problem
2017-10-20 15:58:26	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-10-20 16:01:20	jbaker10	@jeffrey I think I got you beat
2017-10-20 16:01:57	jeffrey	Have you been to a lug meeting?
2017-10-20 16:03:27	jbaker10	Good point
2017-10-20 16:03:45	jbaker10	I'm just here to troll @pbui
2017-10-20 16:04:03	jbaker10	Until he can teach me about C++11 arrays
2017-10-20 16:04:44	jeffrey	How do I study algs?
2017-10-20 16:05:37	jbaker10	Solve vertex cover in P then submit to Chen your paper. I'm sure he'll let you get an A
2017-10-20 16:07:09	jeffrey	We get a cheat sheet, but I forget how long it is. 2 sheets front and back, maybe?

2017-10-20 16:41:23	ssjohns	But it was part of a larger 3 part thing we were working on.
2017-10-20 16:41:54	ssjohns	Honestly it's a milestone. Apparently it's like a rite to break reddit and it's like an accomplishment the first time you do it.

2017-10-20 19:45:37	pbui	b/c from my understanding arkansas doesnt do so well in academic achievement
2017-10-20 19:45:45	pbui	but then again, i dont know much about the state
2017-10-20 19:46:36	ewilli23	Yeah our public schools kinda suck
2017-10-20 19:46:43	ewilli23	At least in Little Rock
2017-10-20 19:47:08	ewilli23	IMO students shouldn’t need monetary incentives
2017-10-20 19:47:27	ewilli23	That money could be better spent improving the quality of the education in the first place
2017-10-20 19:47:36	pbui	yeah, that's what im thinking too
2017-10-20 19:47:51	pbui	i feel this just rewards those w/ access to good support and education
2017-10-20 19:48:02	pbui	like they are already setup to succeed, why reward them
2017-10-20 19:48:14	pbui	it's the kids who cant even get a AP CS class that need the money
2017-10-20 19:50:09	ewilli23	Exactly
2017-10-20 19:50:39	ewilli23	There is money that goes to the school as well, but I see the same problems
2017-10-20 19:50:48	pbui	u ready to play your heart out tomorrow
2017-10-20 19:51:00	pbui	when does the band need to assemble when there is a late game
2017-10-20 19:51:02	ewilli23	Money as an incentive for high performance just rewards the schools already succeeding
2017-10-20 19:51:19	ewilli23	Fun fact I’m not playing anything tomorrow
2017-10-20 19:51:27	ewilli23	We have rehearsal at 11:30
2017-10-20 19:51:45	pbui	y arent u playing anything?
2017-10-20 19:52:18	ewilli23	:guardsman:
2017-10-20 19:52:27	ewilli23	I’m in the Irish Guard
2017-10-20 19:52:30	pbui	wut
2017-10-20 19:52:39	ewilli23	Concert on the Steps is at 6
2017-10-20 19:52:39	pbui	HOW DID I NOT KNOW THIS
2017-10-20 19:52:47	ewilli23	Come watch me dance in a skirt
2017-10-20 19:52:54	pbui	dang, so u can jig?
2017-10-20 19:53:05	ewilli23	Clog is the technical term
2017-10-20 19:53:11	pbui	semantics
2017-10-20 19:53:21	pbui	how often do u have to practice clogging
2017-10-20 19:53:46	ewilli23	We practiced a few times at the beginning of the year
2017-10-20 19:53:56	ewilli23	I’m hoping we get a chance to go over it tomorrow
2017-10-20 19:54:08	ewilli23	Haven’t done it since the Temple game
2017-10-20 19:54:09	pbui	i hope u get a chance to do it :]
2017-10-20 19:54:41	ewilli23	+180k
2017-10-20 19:54:55	ewilli23	Also I get to raise the flag tomorrow
2017-10-20 19:55:03	pbui	is that like a big deal?
2017-10-20 19:55:11	pbui	like internally for the guard?
2017-10-20 19:56:23	ewilli23	Not really. The bigger thing is walking out to receive the flag from whoever is presenting it. But I like doing it.
2017-10-20 19:57:10	ewilli23	The person carrying the flag usually gets a long closeup on the jumbotron
2017-10-20 19:57:16	pbui	do u practice the slow march
2017-10-20 19:57:27	ewilli23	Yes
2017-10-20 19:57:33	pbui	lol
2017-10-20 19:57:53	ewilli23	Why is that funny
2017-10-20 19:58:05	pbui	just the idea of practicing a slow march
2017-10-20 19:58:12	ewilli23	It’s difficult to stay together when there is no beat to march to
2017-10-20 19:58:19	pbui	yeah, i can see that
2017-10-20 20:04:49	flynn	#lug full of excellent talented people
2017-10-20 20:10:12	ccarball	Ewilli23: i wanna see you dance in a skirt pls
2017-10-20 20:12:20	pbui	ccarball: go to the game... oh wait [cc: ccarball]
2017-10-20 20:19:46	catvajiac	wow
2017-10-20 20:39:33	ccarball	Oh wait what?
2017-10-20 20:43:35	pbui	anyone try this font: http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/ 
2017-10-20 20:52:53	ewilli23	@ccarball come to Bond at 6 (except get there early to get a spot)
2017-10-20 20:58:47	dchiang	@pbui I think I was using it inadvertently for a while and liked it
2017-10-20 21:12:33	pbui	I just updated the void package for it
2017-10-20 21:12:46	pbui	I kinda like it, except the zeros
2017-10-20 21:59:30	8bit	the zeros are kinda ugly
2017-10-20 23:01:59	dchiang	agreed
2017-10-20 23:02:58	dchiang	oh this is a nice page for testing: http://app.programmingfonts.org/#anka-coder 
2017-10-20 23:26:10	catvajiac	what, I've been looking for something like that
2017-10-20 23:26:26	catvajiac	now i'm going to spend forever looking at fonts instead of being productive :)
2017-10-21 00:21:58	dchiang	what i have trouble keeping track of is which fonts are derived from which
2017-10-21 00:22:35	dchiang	for example, if i'm not mistaken, bitstream vera sans mono -> deja vu sans mono -> source code
2017-10-21 00:24:27	dchiang	oh hack also belongs to this family
2017-10-21 00:28:12	dchiang	oh and source code does not
2017-10-21 09:40:36	pbui	@8bit: xtraeme merged 3 of my PRs, i feel honored
2017-10-21 09:41:29	8bit	wait, is he the guy that went awol?
2017-10-21 09:41:37	pbui	yeah
2017-10-21 09:41:42	8bit	oh snap
2017-10-21 09:41:45	8bit	thats cool

2017-10-21 09:53:19	pbui	a study on the outcomes of hiring CS faculty last year
2017-10-21 09:53:38	pbui	looks like ai/dm/ml and security are great demand
2017-10-21 09:53:59	pbui	even some theory/algs folks had success :]
2017-10-21 09:57:40	walter.scheirer	yay, everything i do is in great demand :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-10-21 09:57:57	pbui	and nothing i do!
2017-10-21 10:01:41	walter.scheirer	time for you to pivot
2017-10-21 10:02:11	pbui	meh, i ll survive
2017-10-21 10:02:44	pbui	in my professional statement, i spent all of 1 paragraph to explain my research agenda, which was "i teach 3 classes a semester, i dont have time to do research"
2017-10-21 10:03:49	pbui	my specialty is not specializing
2017-10-21 10:04:35	pbui	how is eddy st this morning @walter.scheirer ?
2017-10-21 10:04:39	pbui	already bumping?
2017-10-21 10:04:43	walter.scheirer	seems quiet
2017-10-21 10:05:33	walter.scheirer	i just took a look outside, nobody is around...
2017-10-21 10:05:34	walter.scheirer	weird
2017-10-21 10:14:53	flynn	Hoping for strong prof-hiring this year :muscle:

2017-10-21 12:40:18	pbui	@wtheisen: soon, soon...
2017-10-21 12:40:46	pbui	how is campus now?
2017-10-21 12:44:23	flynn	I am hanging out in my office. DeBartolo quad is pretty dead. The main library lot is pretty full. Haven't seen the stadium lot yet
2017-10-21 12:44:37	ccarball	lafun is pretty quiet surprisingly enough
2017-10-21 12:45:26	flynn	Very few cars at White Field. Hopefully easy-out for me (I have to go to the Development tailgate but am not attending the game)
2017-10-21 12:50:46	walter.scheirer	i guess it is a night game
2017-10-21 12:52:01	flynn	It will probably be pretty crazy by 4pm or so

2017-10-21 13:20:58	walter.scheirer	haha

2017-10-21 15:44:33	pbui	instead of throwing the ball away, the texas qb floats it into the endzone and is picked off
2017-10-21 15:45:07	walter.scheirer	texas isn't that good
2017-10-21 15:46:20	pbui	yeah, but they could have beaten the no. 11 team in the country
2017-10-21 15:46:22	pbui	and helped us out
2017-10-21 15:46:35	walter.scheirer	true
2017-10-21 15:55:21	ccarball	texas isn't throwing away their shot
2017-10-21 15:55:32	ccarball	pbui: I'm still waiting for those Hamilton lyrics
2017-10-21 15:55:50	pbui	might be a while
2017-10-21 15:56:02	pbui	i wont add them until i see the musical
2017-10-21 15:56:52	ccarball	....

2017-10-21 17:32:28	pbui	ddg isnt working for me:
2017-10-21 17:32:48	pbui	@wtheisen: ive joined u... using xfce4-terminal instead of rxvt-unicode now
2017-10-21 17:32:56	pbui	for the emoji spport :fire:
2017-10-21 17:48:08	wtheisen	what made you switch?
2017-10-21 17:48:21	pbui	emojis
2017-10-21 17:48:33	pbui	no joke, i was trying to get them to work
2017-10-21 17:48:43	pbui	but it just worked w/ xfce4-terminal w/ no config
2017-10-21 17:48:47	pbui	so i decided to just switch to that
2017-10-21 17:48:52	pbui	it was already my backup terminal
2017-10-21 17:56:37	wtheisen	emojis for what, weechat?
2017-10-21 17:56:49	pbui	yes
2017-10-21 18:02:36	pbui	also, i was playing around w/ fonts and color schemes
2017-10-21 18:02:42	pbui	that was easier in xfce4-terminal
2017-10-21 18:02:46	pbui	see, i can change too
2017-10-21 18:02:55	pbui	i should go to the store before the game starts
2017-10-21 18:03:00	wtheisen	are you going to get a real font now?
2017-10-21 18:03:14	pbui	no, i still prefer tamzen
2017-10-21 18:03:23	pbui	i dont like ttf fonts for terminals
2017-10-21 18:03:25	pbui	too blurry
2017-10-21 18:06:06	wtheisen	how else are you going to have all kinds of fancy icons in vim tho?
2017-10-21 18:08:22	pbui	i dont
2017-10-21 18:08:26	pbui	im not cool like that
2017-10-21 18:08:56	wtheisen	but it’s so necessary for my workflow
2017-10-21 19:31:29	pbui	My body is ready, let's go Irish
2017-10-21 19:53:04	walter.scheirer	Strong start
2017-10-21 19:54:25	wtheisen	if we win this I'll do my grading
2017-10-21 20:05:17	wtheisen	we are actually running the ball, wow
2017-10-21 20:06:23	flynn	wow - great start to this game - first score capitalized on a mistake; second was a solid drive
2017-10-21 20:07:00	wtheisen	yeah we put in *work* on that drive
2017-10-21 20:07:46	walter.scheirer	Lots of energy in the stadium
2017-10-21 20:07:53	walter.scheirer	Wireless seems stable
2017-10-21 20:12:31	jeffrey	I'm so excited
2017-10-21 20:12:33	jeffrey	If we win
2017-10-21 20:12:35	jeffrey	Wow
2017-10-21 20:13:00	jeffrey	I might die
2017-10-21 20:25:29	wtheisen	what is our secondary doing
2017-10-21 20:42:47	flynn	omg
2017-10-21 20:44:41	flynn	14 points off of usc mistakes.
2017-10-21 20:52:16	walter.scheirer	This game
2017-10-21 20:52:35	walter.scheirer	I’m here with Adam czjaka
2017-10-21 20:52:44	walter.scheirer	He has his pro camera with him

2017-10-21 21:01:02	flynn	make that 21 points from usc mistakes… very surprising
2017-10-21 21:01:18	walter.scheirer	Just me and Adam
2017-10-21 21:18:03	pbui	What does it mean when your team is up 28-0 and you are still worried
2017-10-21 21:18:27	pbui	Bc I still am
2017-10-21 21:18:30	wtheisen	you’re realistic
2017-10-21 21:18:31	catvajiac	um, it means ur a ND football fan?
2017-10-21 21:18:34	wtheisen	same here
2017-10-21 21:18:37	pbui	Exactly
2017-10-21 21:18:45	pbui	Too early to celebrate
2017-10-21 21:18:56	catvajiac	dont celebrate anybody bc then ull jinx it
2017-10-21 21:19:12	wtheisen	that’s one of the easiest ways to lose a game in my experience
2017-10-21 21:19:18	catvajiac	same
2017-10-21 21:25:33	walter.scheirer	Wow, Chicago is playing live
2017-10-21 21:26:05	ccarball	Chicago was super cool
2017-10-21 21:26:32	ccarball	I can hear it from my window
2017-10-21 21:27:55	walter.scheirer	They’re still playing
2017-10-21 21:29:04	walter.scheirer	Chicago is deploying a keytar player
2017-10-21 21:29:08	walter.scheirer	Intense
2017-10-21 21:29:28	ccarball	walter.scheirer: Yeah I can hear them playing
2017-10-21 21:29:43	ccarball	but they also played with the band earlier on bond
2017-10-21 21:29:45	ccarball	it was cool
2017-10-21 21:30:17	walter.scheirer	The best part of this: USC has their kicker on the field practicing
2017-10-21 21:34:49	walter.scheirer	second half
2017-10-21 21:45:52	jeffrey	Sad
2017-10-21 21:46:19	pbui	We need to answer
2017-10-21 21:54:19	walter.scheirer	Answer delivered
2017-10-21 21:54:48	wtheisen	that was another good drive
2017-10-21 21:56:08	walter.scheirer	@pbui is still skeptical of our performance
2017-10-21 21:56:33	wtheisen	i mean it would be very ND to lose this game
2017-10-21 22:00:02	pbui	Still skerred
2017-10-21 22:04:07	walter.scheirer	@pbui is clenching his teeth after that TD
2017-10-21 22:04:37	catvajiac	pbui: clearly has seen enough ND football to be wisely cautious
2017-10-21 22:06:02	pbui	I've seen enough college football in general
2017-10-21 22:06:25	pbui	Last week like six unranked teams beat ranked teams
2017-10-21 22:06:30	pbui	Anything can happen
2017-10-21 22:07:05	pbui	Patriot falcons
2017-10-21 22:07:28	walter.scheirer	One more USC TD and he’ll be in the fetal position
2017-10-21 22:07:40	walter.scheirer	Wifi is getting spotty
2017-10-21 22:07:52	walter.scheirer	Aaron assure me it would be great
2017-10-21 22:08:31	pbui	Lol
2017-10-21 22:08:38	pbui	Adams
2017-10-21 22:08:44	pbui	Every game
2017-10-21 22:15:22	walter.scheirer	Things are getting serious, they’re playing crazy train

2017-10-22 00:30:04	jbaker10	Lol ND won? XD
2017-10-22 02:02:45	ewilli23	@ccarball you didn’t go to the game??
2017-10-22 02:03:21	ccarball	ewilli23: sold my ticket

2017-10-22 09:38:40	pbui	@alitteke: @jbaker10 maybe for the next podcast we can talk about 1. evaluation teachers (turn the tables) 2. how to succeed in CS courses (builds off assessment and related to article above)
2017-10-22 10:09:40	wtheisen	that article was kinda dumb
2017-10-22 10:09:54	pbui	go on
2017-10-22 10:10:23	wtheisen	there was nothing interesting in it. it was the same 6 things all those articles say
2017-10-22 10:12:20	pbui	fair enough
2017-10-22 10:12:42	pbui	just added tmux plugin to open URLs
2017-10-22 10:12:44	pbui	is excite
2017-10-22 10:49:53	wtheisen	why tmux over screen
2017-10-22 12:00:25	pbui	Better command line interface, better split support
2017-10-22 12:00:43	pbui	Screen was also abandoned for a while
2017-10-22 12:58:59	jeffrey	Screen let's you talk to a serial port tho
2017-10-22 13:51:23	pbui	easier to script and extend tmux
2017-10-22 13:51:32	pbui	i never talk to a serial port

2017-10-22 17:48:16	pbui	resent as in you sent to to someone, or resent as in you are bothered by it
2017-10-22 17:48:24	pbui	im guessing the latter since you are a troll
2017-10-22 18:09:44	jbaker10	I'm a what?
2017-10-22 18:09:52	jbaker10	A troll? Never heard of this
2017-10-22 18:20:19	alitteke	The next episode of the podcast just passed the hour mark, I hope you’re both proud of this truly amazing milestone
2017-10-22 18:48:58	jbaker10	I'm really not
2017-10-22 18:49:02	jbaker10	I blame Bui
2017-10-22 18:49:15	jbaker10	He decided to have some soul searching in this episode

2017-10-22 20:09:29	dougsmith	I feel like lug plays pokemon would be twitch plays pokemon if only trolls were allowed to play
2017-10-22 20:09:30	ewilli23	Ohhh can we do lug installs gentoo r/place style
2017-10-22 20:09:41	ewilli23	Every five minutes you get to input a character to stdin
2017-10-22 20:09:42	pbui	dougsmith: is considering a gentoo install
2017-10-22 20:09:54	pbui	also, dont forget that wmarkley is talking about linux from scratch
2017-10-22 20:10:00	pbui	which is closely related (this week)

2017-10-24 01:31:26	alitteke	you say that…
2017-10-24 01:31:41	jbaker10	I'll cradle its head in my hand carefully
2017-10-24 01:32:02	walter.scheirer	I also won’t use faceID other than for curiosity
2017-10-24 01:32:22	jbaker10	do you have a choice?
2017-10-24 01:32:41	walter.scheirer	I believe you can still use a PIN
2017-10-24 01:32:44	alitteke	you can turn it off and just use a passcode
2017-10-24 01:33:03	jbaker10	wouldn't put it past apple to not give you that choice
2017-10-24 01:33:04	alitteke	you can do that now with the touchID
2017-10-24 01:33:09	jbaker10	but who am I to question it
2017-10-24 01:33:20	jbaker10	i am but a mortal consumer
2017-10-24 01:44:03	ssjohns	90% sure they only adopted face id and dropped touch id because the FBI used touch id to get into iphones
2017-10-24 01:44:37	ssjohns	Like they just made molds of fingerprints and used it to unlock them. Which made APple so mad.
2017-10-24 01:48:16	alitteke	They also probably wanted edge to edge screen and didn’t want to stick it on the back
2017-10-24 01:48:36	flynn	One of the people on the Apple face ID team is an ND alum. He called me the day of the release to brag

2017-10-24 07:25:22	8bit	From our conversation w/ batrick I was kinda under the impression that you couldn't do anything "cool" (ML, etc) without some grad school.  Is that generally true?
2017-10-24 07:36:15	pbui	It's harder, not impossible
2017-10-24 07:36:26	pbui	You have to forge your own path
2017-10-24 07:36:51	pbui	Also depends on your definition of cool
2017-10-24 08:15:20	wtheisen	to those about to algs today, we salute you o7
2017-10-24 08:26:44	walter.scheirer	hmm... there's eduroam AP on the Lido
2017-10-24 08:27:18	pbui	@wtheisen: o7
2017-10-24 08:27:25	pbui	@walter.scheirer: honeypot
2017-10-24 08:27:39	walter.scheirer	haha, that was my first thought
2017-10-24 08:33:03	walter.scheirer	@dchiang and @tweninger: you should see my hotel room
2017-10-24 08:33:26	walter.scheirer	my room at hotel celio could fit in the bathroom
2017-10-24 08:41:39	tweninger	Celio hotel was teenie.
2017-10-24 08:42:05	walter.scheirer	here i have an ocean front suite
2017-10-24 08:43:17	wtheisen	just stop
2017-10-24 08:43:45	walter.scheirer	in a hotel that hosts the venice film festival
2017-10-24 08:47:42	tweninger	Where are you from St Mark's?
2017-10-24 08:47:59	walter.scheirer	different island
2017-10-24 08:48:11	walter.scheirer	the long sandbar
2017-10-24 08:48:33	tweninger	Oh gotcha.
2017-10-24 08:49:39	tweninger	Im in DC, new hotel. I'm pretty sure that I'm the first to stay in this room. There was no shower curtain, and I peeled the protective wrapping off the faucet!
2017-10-24 08:52:00	walter.scheirer	haah
2017-10-24 09:00:33	walter.scheirer	https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/922809654819815426 
2017-10-24 09:00:36	walter.scheirer	NOOOOOO
2017-10-24 09:12:19	wtheisen	I actually tried getting into emacs over break
2017-10-24 09:12:31	wtheisen	couldn’t do it
2017-10-24 11:16:13	dchiang	it would be interesting to see whether emacs/vim usage correlates with age
2017-10-24 11:19:17	walter.scheirer	my phd advisor swears by emacs
2017-10-24 11:19:20	walter.scheirer	he never leaves the environemnt
2017-10-24 11:19:30	walter.scheirer	it's like his OS
2017-10-24 11:19:46	dchiang	oh yeah i tried to do that for a while
2017-10-24 11:19:53	dchiang	read my email in emacs
2017-10-24 11:20:09	ewilli23	TIL emacs has a full client implementation of the hypertext coffee pot control protocol
2017-10-24 11:20:30	dchiang	received psychotherapy in emacs, you know, that kind of stuff
2017-10-24 11:20:46	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-10-24 11:20:51	ewilli23	So if you have an IoT coffeepot you can probably brew coffee with emacs
2017-10-24 11:21:31	dchiang	hm, https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/350926/2017-survey-vim-is-for-old-people-joking 
2017-10-24 11:23:56	wtheisen	Calling it an IDE, _triggered_
2017-10-24 11:25:21	dchiang	emacs's gdb mode is nice
2017-10-24 11:36:13	dchiang	@dchiang uploaded a file: plot.png https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0M9L0KT6/F7P5W5ZTN/plot.png 
2017-10-24 11:36:47	dchiang	20 actually means 20+
2017-10-24 11:37:32	dchiang	i am guessing that "years programming for work" correlates with age better than "years programming"
2017-10-24 11:37:47	dchiang	vim wins across the board but i think there's a pretty good correlation with age here
2017-10-24 11:37:55	dchiang	i don't know what happened with that dip at 18
2017-10-24 11:39:01	dchiang	those people would have graduated from college in 1999
2017-10-24 11:47:05	dchiang	and the 2nd peak at 14 is the class of 2003
2017-10-24 12:27:14	jbaker10	Some of the comments on that article though....
2017-10-24 12:27:32	jbaker10	Guess it isn't an article, post I should say
2017-10-24 13:57:18	jeffrey	Oh are you podcasting right now @jbaker10 @alitteke @pbui
2017-10-24 13:57:31	jbaker10	Yes
2017-10-24 13:57:33	jbaker10	Done now
2017-10-24 14:09:05	ncarroll	@pbui we need to talk about this in ethics
2017-10-24 14:09:10	ncarroll	http://www.clickhole.com/article/jeff-bezos-just-tossed-nail-studded-baseball-bat-f-6857#1 ,
2017-10-24 14:53:41	pbui	Amazon should come to South bend
2017-10-24 14:54:18	walter.scheirer	at least one city in indiana put in a bid
2017-10-24 14:54:20	walter.scheirer	probably indy
2017-10-24 14:55:01	walter.scheirer	wow, apparently Gary bid
2017-10-24 15:01:04	pbui	indy would be cool too

2017-10-24 15:46:54	jeffrey	They're not done yet
2017-10-24 15:47:18	jeffrey	The contributing post is wrong, even
2017-10-24 15:59:22	jeffrey	wait does it say "you should join lug" every time you open slack for everyone, or just me?
2017-10-24 15:59:27	jeffrey	Did @ncarroll hack my computer
2017-10-24 16:01:59	pbui	hey, @androidkitkat has an idea for a "fun" lug night, which is retro OS night
2017-10-24 16:02:15	androidkitkat	DOS!!!
2017-10-24 16:02:15	pbui	like demo some old operating systems like DOS, Windows 3.11
2017-10-24 16:02:18	pbui	etc
2017-10-24 16:02:28	pbui	even maybe some old linux versions
2017-10-24 16:02:31	androidkitkat	maybe even the DOS hell
2017-10-24 16:02:31	pbui	like slackware 1.0
2017-10-24 16:02:34	androidkitkat	Shell*
2017-10-24 16:04:58	walter.scheirer	that'd be like reliving my life, circa the mid-90s
2017-10-24 16:05:37	jeffrey	were the 90s anything like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pa6SGYWADU  ?
2017-10-24 16:05:48	walter.scheirer	we did have N64
2017-10-24 16:06:10	jeffrey	we don't
2017-10-24 16:06:14	jeffrey	things were better then
2017-10-24 16:06:15	walter.scheirer	sad
2017-10-24 16:06:23	jeffrey	now all is lost, including hope, which is dead
2017-10-24 16:07:43	pbui	PIZZA PARTIES
2017-10-24 16:08:17	pbui	i sort of want a pizza party
2017-10-24 16:08:35	jeffrey	lugsgiving at chuckecheese?
2017-10-24 16:08:46	pbui	my kids would approve
2017-10-24 16:09:16	jeffrey	We could have fun tricking the ticket counter
2017-10-24 16:09:29	jeffrey	which I guess is exactly the same as stealing?
2017-10-24 16:09:30	ewilli23	@androidkitkat can you bring that usb cable back tomorrow night?
2017-10-24 16:09:37	walter.scheirer	i'll show up to "fun" lug night wearing a ripped skinny puppy t-shirt, with a 486 desktop running slack in tow
2017-10-24 16:09:39	androidkitkat	si
2017-10-24 16:09:44	walter.scheirer	we're going to re-live those 90s...
2017-10-24 16:10:13	jeffrey	I think I shared a picture from either the late 90s or early 00s in here once
2017-10-24 16:10:22	jeffrey	of one of my sisters using our home computer
2017-10-24 16:10:42	walter.scheirer	giant CRT?
2017-10-24 16:10:44	jeffrey	ye
2017-10-24 16:10:56	jeffrey	I miss when having our speakers near the monitor messed it up
2017-10-24 16:11:22	pbui	i heard that the dream of the 90s lives on in portlandia
2017-10-24 16:12:17	walter.scheirer	i wonder if i have some pics of my network from that era
2017-10-24 16:12:32	androidkitkat	@walter.scheirer where do i get period correct hardware for DOS 6.22
2017-10-24 16:12:42	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-10-24 16:12:54	walter.scheirer	i am sure there's a lab somewhere in the basement of fitz that can set you up
2017-10-24 16:12:57	androidkitkat	thats what my ultimate dos machine needs
2017-10-24 16:14:21	walter.scheirer	@walter.scheirer uploaded a file: rack.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U3UG53WSF/F7P9SJTU2/rack.jpg  and commented: Old School
2017-10-24 16:14:27	walter.scheirer	early 2000s
2017-10-24 16:14:43	pbui	is this before or after you were in maroon 5
2017-10-24 16:14:46	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-10-24 16:14:54	pbui	dat openbsd
2017-10-24 16:14:57	walter.scheirer	was maroon 5 even a band back then?
2017-10-24 16:14:58	jeffrey	During, that's their mixing hardware
2017-10-24 16:15:13	androidkitkat	look at all the beige
2017-10-24 16:15:25	jeffrey	maroon 5 is older than I am @walter.scheirer
2017-10-24 16:15:29	walter.scheirer	@walter.scheirer uploaded a file: sun.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U3UG53WSF/F7PDX59SR/sun.jpg 
2017-10-24 16:15:45	walter.scheirer	DEC monitor being used with a sun workstation
2017-10-24 16:15:48	walter.scheirer	how elite is that?
2017-10-24 16:15:57	pbui	we are not worthy
2017-10-24 16:16:09	walter.scheirer	i believe the machine under the sun is a 486
2017-10-24 16:16:27	pbui	whar da turbo button
2017-10-24 16:16:35	jeffrey	I think lug should try building a simple computer with like a Z80 or such
2017-10-24 16:16:51	androidkitkat	it isnt a real 90s machine if it doesnt have a display where it shows clock speed
2017-10-24 16:16:58	pbui	oh, actually, i have a project idea for someone
2017-10-24 16:17:07	jeffrey	maybe enslave a pi to act as its supporting hardware
2017-10-24 16:17:17	walter.scheirer	the two boxes on the bottom do show clock speed
2017-10-24 16:17:33	pbui	it comes from corey, he wants someone to build a "chromecast"-like networking setup utility for the RPIs
2017-10-24 16:17:41	walter.scheirer	sadly, all of these machines were retired and recycled ages ago
2017-10-24 16:17:47	pbui	so u can just plugin a RPI and then use another machine to setup its networking
2017-10-24 16:17:53	jeffrey	I still don't get why it's called a turbo button and not a "compatibility speed" button
2017-10-24 16:17:57	jeffrey	is it just marketing?
2017-10-24 16:18:13	jeffrey	plug in how @pbui?
2017-10-24 16:18:25	jeffrey	plugin to the wall, or the machine you are configuring?
2017-10-24 16:18:33	jeffrey	configuring with*
2017-10-24 16:19:45	pbui	into the wall
2017-10-24 16:19:51	pbui	so like u plug it into a TV
2017-10-24 16:19:58	pbui	or just an outlet
2017-10-24 16:20:13	pbui	u want to use your phone to tell it to connect to this wifi network w/ these settings
2017-10-24 16:20:23	pbui	u would basically need to start the pi in AP mode
2017-10-24 16:20:48	jeffrey	ok, so like how all the annoying IoT things do it
2017-10-24 16:21:42	pbui	yeah
2017-10-24 16:21:44	pbui	it's corey's idea
2017-10-24 16:21:51	pbui	and @flynn gave us a few pis
2017-10-24 16:21:57	pbui	so we could do something w/ them
2017-10-24 16:22:24	androidkitkat	make a botnet w them
2017-10-24 16:22:48	pbui	we can have them connect to this channel, and then control them remotely
2017-10-24 16:22:51	pbui	mwuahaha

2017-10-24 17:06:17	dougsmith	jeffrey: it's testing your defenses. Checking your workspaces for weaknesses.
2017-10-24 17:06:20	androidkitkat	its trying to get you to use Unity Desktop

2017-10-24 17:07:17	pbui	unity is dead
2017-10-24 17:07:39	jeffrey	yeah move it to general
2017-10-24 17:10:54	androidkitkat	does unity now count as "retro"
2017-10-24 17:11:16	androidkitkat	if so, can i show it off at retro os night
2017-10-24 17:11:19	pbui	i heard on a podcast that it is still available
2017-10-24 17:11:23	pbui	just wont get updates
2017-10-24 17:11:33	pbui	and will be removed in a later version
2017-10-24 17:11:33	androidkitkat	so its just deprecated
2017-10-24 17:11:45	androidkitkat	#bringunityback
2017-10-24 17:12:15	pbui	https://yunit.io/ 
2017-10-24 17:13:04	androidkitkat	ooo we should also show off Mandrake Linux
2017-10-24 17:13:39	pbui	that was one of my first linux distros
2017-10-24 17:13:48	pbui	i think it was the first one i managed to install
2017-10-24 17:13:51	pbui	on my pentium II
2017-10-24 17:14:06	androidkitkat	it was super easy to install
2017-10-24 17:14:19	androidkitkat	it came with instructions to install it alongside windows
2017-10-24 17:15:44	androidkitkat	old hardware is :heart:
2017-10-24 17:16:41	jeffrey	OK fam, how is http://ndlug.org/post/contributing/  ?
2017-10-24 17:18:43	androidkitkat	so the blog is a repository that we fork and make commits to?
2017-10-24 17:18:59	jeffrey	I think that might be the best way to do it, yes
2017-10-24 17:19:09	androidkitkat	it involves linux
2017-10-24 17:19:14	androidkitkat	so :thumbsup:
2017-10-24 17:19:23	androidkitkat	now to get this to work on DOS...
2017-10-24 17:19:39	jeffrey	do... do  you actually have something running DOS?
2017-10-24 17:19:49	jeffrey	I mean, personally, I'd rather you get it working in basekernel
2017-10-24 17:19:49	androidkitkat	vbox
2017-10-24 17:19:54	dougsmith	^
2017-10-24 17:20:16	androidkitkat	i dont think dos would play nice with 24 GB of ram and a core i7
2017-10-24 17:20:21	androidkitkat	or any modern chipset
2017-10-24 17:20:49	androidkitkat	or have USB drivers for my keyboard
2017-10-24 17:21:13	androidkitkat	but i want to get a dos machine
2017-10-24 17:21:19	androidkitkat	the *ULTIMATE DOS MACHINE*
2017-10-24 17:21:28	jeffrey	Does DOS address more than 1MB of ram?
2017-10-24 17:21:44	androidkitkat	it can i think
2017-10-24 17:21:47	androidkitkat	later versions
2017-10-24 17:22:23	androidkitkat	https://i.imgur.com/qImxU7J.png 
2017-10-24 17:22:46	androidkitkat	the high memory area is available tho
2017-10-24 17:22:46	jeffrey	old memory confuses me
2017-10-24 17:22:59	jeffrey	the cpu has 20ish address pins
2017-10-24 17:23:30	androidkitkat	let me try giving dos 1 GB of ram for fun
2017-10-24 17:24:02	jeffrey	Oh, I bet you can hardware "OK, I want to address _this_ 1MB chunk now"
2017-10-24 17:24:13	jeffrey	tell the hardware*
2017-10-24 17:24:22	androidkitkat	64 MB is max i think
2017-10-24 17:24:33	androidkitkat	i gave it 8 GB of ram in my system
2017-10-24 17:24:44	androidkitkat	and it reports 64 MB
2017-10-24 17:26:59	dougsmith	It found _some_ of the RAM
2017-10-24 17:27:42	jeffrey	the internet says 64MB extended is the limit
2017-10-24 17:27:43	jeffrey	but why?
2017-10-24 17:28:35	androidkitkat	i know that windows 95 poops the bed with more than 1 GB of ram
2017-10-24 17:28:53	androidkitkat	you have to add some line to autoexec.bat
2017-10-24 17:29:28	jeffrey	like, it crashes or something, or just doesn't see it?
2017-10-24 17:29:34	androidkitkat	it crashes
2017-10-24 17:29:41	androidkitkat	you can install it just fine with 1 GB
2017-10-24 17:29:48	androidkitkat	but when you reboot
2017-10-24 17:29:58	androidkitkat	it just says it doesnt have enough memory
2017-10-24 17:30:09	jeffrey	so weird
2017-10-24 17:30:21	androidkitkat	i read online that something where it reaches too much ram and just says you have 0 K
2017-10-24 17:30:48	jeffrey	but that's a weird number to have as a limit
2017-10-24 17:30:53	androidkitkat	ik
2017-10-24 17:31:04	androidkitkat	DOS is fun tho
2017-10-24 17:31:18	jeffrey	but also I'm still confused about how to address more than 1MB
2017-10-24 17:31:42	androidkitkat	ask nicely
2017-10-24 17:39:16	jeffrey	I have a theory about the 64MB thing
2017-10-24 17:39:27	jeffrey	"BIOS call 0x0088 measures memory as follows:
2017-10-24 17:39:27	jeffrey	%ax returns memory above 1MB in 1KB increments, maxiumum of 64MB."

2017-10-24 18:34:31	bdevorem	Email to female CS students at umass: ```Hello CS Women, 
2017-10-24 18:34:31	bdevorem	In light of the Google memo and Harvey Weinstein, several graduate students (both men and women) are planning to organize a male ally training workshop for CICS graduate students sometime in late November. 
2017-10-24 18:34:31	bdevorem	We would greatly appreciate if you could take 5-10 minutes to fill out our survey on sexism in this department and in academic environments in general; we will use the responses to shape the direction of our workshop.
2017-10-24 18:34:31	bdevorem	If you have any comments or concerns about the email or survey, please email me directly. Additionally, if you don't feel comfortable sharing via these channels, here is a list of campus resources. 
2017-10-24 18:34:31	bdevorem	Thanks```
2017-10-24 18:35:10	dchiang	16-bit x86 machines had 20 address bits
2017-10-24 18:36:09	dchiang	16 bits for segment and 16 bits for offset, but the segments overlapped so you effectively got 20 bits
2017-10-24 18:36:46	dchiang	32-bit machines had 32 bit addresses but I believe they also have/had some kind of segmenting system to get more than 4G
2017-10-24 18:37:47	dchiang	There was a period of time when there were crazy systems called ems and xms that allowed you to get more than 1G in 16-bit mode
2017-10-24 18:38:38	dchiang	Ems mapped the additional memory into unused ranges above 640k. I don't know how xms worked
2017-10-24 19:04:10	pbui	takes notes
2017-10-24 19:09:18	jbaker10	I wish I had Dchiang as a professor
2017-10-24 19:11:11	pbui	me too

2017-10-24 20:05:21	jeffrey	Thanks @dchiang
2017-10-24 20:05:51	jeffrey	So, a group on campus wants them to add a Wi-Fi web filter
2017-10-24 20:10:43	pbui	explain
2017-10-24 20:10:52	pbui	what is a wi-fi web filter
2017-10-24 20:10:55	pbui	and what group
2017-10-24 20:14:52	jeffrey	SCOP, whatever that is
2017-10-24 20:15:10	ssjohns	So two things.
2017-10-24 20:15:24	jeffrey	And I don't disagree with their motives
2017-10-24 20:15:24	ssjohns	1) Apparently Mac has a weird thing around encryption
2017-10-24 20:15:58	ssjohns	2) The way we encrpyt our drives and use file vault makes any partition alway overflow nad rewrite the entire disk.
2017-10-24 20:16:08	jeffrey	And I don't know quite what the details on this wifi filter are, there was just a schedule saying they are petitioning for a wifi filter
2017-10-24 20:16:26	ssjohns	I did everything write whe nmaking my ubuntu partition. It was the hardware that was wrong and betrayed me.
2017-10-24 20:17:20	pbui	jeffrey: what are their motives
2017-10-24 20:18:01	jeffrey	I'll just share the schedule from NDH
2017-10-24 20:18:19	jeffrey	@jeffrey uploaded a file: WRAP Week Schedule 2017.pdf https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0L54J0MD/F7NT6HZG9/wrap_week_schedule_2017.pdf 
2017-10-24 20:19:20	pbui	we should talk about this in ethics
2017-10-24 20:19:31	pbui	maybe when we talk about censorship and freedom of speech
2017-10-24 20:21:40	jeffrey	I was shown the flier right after I finished lecturing my friends about why we want net neutrality and free software
2017-10-24 20:22:01	pbui	cute
2017-10-24 20:22:40	pbui	i can bring this up as a local example of filtering
2017-10-24 20:31:30	ncarroll	bring up the jeff bezos article as an example of ruthlessness
2017-10-24 21:20:47	jeffrey	Do we want, say, jenkins to automatically build the ndlug site?
2017-10-24 21:21:27	bobbit	From "NDLUG Blog" feed: Will Markley Linux From Scratch by Unknown @ https://yld.me/Auo 
2017-10-24 21:22:32	jeffrey	not jenkins, travis CI
2017-10-24 21:23:31	8bit	I want jenkins to automatically build the ndlug site
2017-10-24 21:25:36	jeffrey	no jenkins
2017-10-24 21:25:41	jeffrey	we don't have one of those
2017-10-24 21:26:46	8bit	We have one.
2017-10-24 21:27:04	8bit	fr. jenkins probably can carve a bit of time out to build our site
2017-10-24 21:31:08	pbui	jeffrey: that would be cool
2017-10-24 21:31:14	pbui	and then u can explain it

2017-10-25 10:39:11	ncarroll	@jeffrey I thought the first and the fourth problems werent too bad
2017-10-25 10:44:59	jeffrey	what? It isn't working for me >.<
2017-10-25 10:45:22	jeffrey	@ncarroll I didn't think any of it was as bad as I expected it to be
2017-10-25 10:45:38	ncarroll	I had no expectations, so...
2017-10-25 10:50:39	ncarroll	I think I could have gotten between a 40 and a 60.  depends on how much partial credit I would get on 2 and 3
2017-10-25 11:29:02	androidkitkat	does anyone know how to get write access to a VDI
2017-10-25 11:32:59	androidkitkat	vm
2017-10-25 11:33:01	androidkitkat	nvm
2017-10-25 11:40:18	androidkitkat	i did it
2017-10-25 11:48:05	androidkitkat	ok dos is slow tho
2017-10-25 11:48:31	noah.y	@jeffrey try student 00
2017-10-25 12:25:03	jeffrey	That worked, thanks
2017-10-25 12:37:25	jeffrey	Let's make a fork of Jenkins and name it Fr. Jenkins. The only difference is it will occasionally increase build times by 3.7%.
2017-10-25 12:40:23	androidkitkat	As a freshman, I can't et behind this
2017-10-25 12:58:27	jbaker10	Who is Jenkins?
2017-10-25 13:00:25	androidkitkat	the command is /whois Jenkins
2017-10-25 13:01:28	jbaker10	Never heard of this guy
2017-10-25 13:01:47	jbaker10	I'm new here though

2017-10-25 16:32:30	jeffrey	Sorry for the Travis spam anyone who gets it
2017-10-25 16:40:43	jeffrey	The good news is now when you push to the site repo, it forces a certain Keenan RA to build the site itself.

2017-10-26 08:32:48	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-10-26 08:34:09	walter.scheirer	i'm growing more concerned about the egregious labor practices in tech

2017-10-26 08:36:41	pbui	academia ftw?
2017-10-26 08:36:59	walter.scheirer	lots of jobs in AI right now
2017-10-26 08:37:02	pbui	actually, maybe not: http://www.nature.com/news/many-junior-scientists-need-to-take-a-hard-look-at-their-job-prospects-1.22879 
2017-10-26 08:37:20	walter.scheirer	oh yeah, the natural sciences are another story
2017-10-26 08:37:26	walter.scheirer	for CS, the job market is fantastic right now
2017-10-26 08:37:32	walter.scheirer	i've never seen it this good
2017-10-26 08:38:37	pbui	yeah...
2017-10-26 08:38:56	walter.scheirer	of course, not in all areas
2017-10-26 08:39:41	pbui	"Of course, now all my other friends say, "Why the hell did you choose to be a professor where you work 80 hours per week and make less than most undergraduates with CS degrees, even when your area of expertise is AI?""

2017-10-26 08:44:45	walter.scheirer	2-3 top tier papers will probably be enough to secure an interview for a vision / ml position

2017-10-26 08:45:05	walter.scheirer	first author, that is

2017-10-26 08:46:48	wtheisen	you like that?
2017-10-26 08:46:55	pbui	i had 1 first author journal paper when i graduate
2017-10-26 08:47:00	walter.scheirer	the neuroscience stats here are ridiculous: http://www.chriskanan.com/planning-for-life-after-your-phd/ 
2017-10-26 08:47:10	walter.scheirer	7 ± 4 First Author Publications
2017-10-26 08:47:18	walter.scheirer	this is virtually impossible
2017-10-26 08:47:21	walter.scheirer	for a grad student
2017-10-26 08:47:29	pbui	i had no first author conference papers
2017-10-26 08:47:30	walter.scheirer	i'd expect that after 2 or 3 post docs
2017-10-26 08:47:45	pbui	i still only have 1 journal and 1 conference paper
2017-10-26 08:47:47	pbui	lol
2017-10-26 08:47:49	walter.scheirer	"Sample Size: 7 (theoretical neuroscientists)"
2017-10-26 08:47:50	walter.scheirer	ohhhh
2017-10-26 08:48:03	walter.scheirer	reasonable, but still a reach, for theorists
2017-10-26 08:48:07	walter.scheirer	really?
2017-10-26 08:48:22	pbui	yeah, i was a terrible grad student when it came to research
2017-10-26 08:48:28	walter.scheirer	tisk tisk
2017-10-26 08:48:44	wtheisen	too many video games?
2017-10-26 08:48:55	pbui	no, i just didnt publish
2017-10-26 08:49:01	pbui	i did a lot of work on cctools
2017-10-26 08:49:19	pbui	i just didnt like publishing and going to conferences and networking

2017-10-26 08:49:40	walter.scheirer	yes
2017-10-26 08:49:45	walter.scheirer	these posts don't mention that
2017-10-26 08:49:47	pbui	meh, i just wanted to teach
2017-10-26 08:49:58	wtheisen	I know that feel
2017-10-26 08:50:01	pbui	i was never going to be a researcher
2017-10-26 08:50:04	walter.scheirer	i'm sitting at a conference *right now*
2017-10-26 08:50:12	pbui	lol
2017-10-26 08:50:13	walter.scheirer	but on the floor in the back
2017-10-26 08:50:18	walter.scheirer	because they ran out of seats
2017-10-26 08:53:19	walter.scheirer	@pbui: you have a google scholar page!
2017-10-26 08:53:21	walter.scheirer	i see more than 2 papers here
2017-10-26 08:53:32	pbui	workshops
2017-10-26 08:53:37	walter.scheirer	ah
2017-10-26 08:53:47	pbui	most of my grad school pubs were workshops
2017-10-26 08:54:19	walter.scheirer	i have imposed a moratorium on workshop papers in my lab
2017-10-26 08:54:31	pbui	i would have died
2017-10-26 08:54:44	walter.scheirer	nah, you would have published great conference and journal papers
2017-10-26 08:55:00	walter.scheirer	i haven't published a workshop paper since 2013
2017-10-26 08:55:00	walter.scheirer	i think
2017-10-26 08:55:30	pbui	i was also no mans land of dthain getting tenure
2017-10-26 08:55:37	pbui	like he got tenure while i was in grad school
2017-10-26 08:56:09	pbui	pre and post tenure demands were very different :]
2017-10-26 08:56:17	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-10-26 08:57:12	walter.scheirer	my expectations won't change after tenure
2017-10-26 08:57:22	walter.scheirer	i plan to continue being a good mentor
2017-10-26 08:57:31	walter.scheirer	that means ensuring student success through good papers
2017-10-26 08:57:55	wtheisen	hi it’s me ur grad student
2017-10-26 08:57:58	pbui	lol

2017-10-26 08:58:08	pbui	o/ <- pick me
2017-10-26 08:58:49	pbui	your expectations might not change, but your engagement might
2017-10-26 08:58:56	pbui	or your intensity
2017-10-26 08:58:58	pbui	i dunno
2017-10-26 08:59:34	walter.scheirer	nah, then i'll be gunning for full professor

2017-10-26 09:00:47	walter.scheirer	hehe
2017-10-26 09:29:01	tweninger	Well that's not creepy at all.
2017-10-26 09:29:14	wtheisen	pbui asked for it
2017-10-26 09:29:17	wtheisen	blame him
2017-10-26 09:29:37	8bit	so you're just enabling pbui, wtheisen?
2017-10-26 09:29:48	wtheisen	yes
2017-10-26 10:24:35	jcioffi	guys today's the first day of my first conference ever. This must be what it's like to be @walter.scheirer or @tweninger
2017-10-26 10:27:37	--	noah.y is now known as silv3r
2017-10-26 11:12:57	walter.scheirer	is your conference in venice too?
2017-10-26 11:21:46	tweninger	Conference Protip for Jess - Talks can be great (many are not). The coffee breaks, dinner, and afterparty is where the important action happens.
2017-10-26 11:22:04	walter.scheirer	heading to conference banquet right now
2017-10-26 11:22:16	walter.scheirer	colocated with the venice biennale
2017-10-26 12:30:17	jcioffi	@walter.scheirer not Venice, I'm not at that point yet, but Texas is still pretty cool
2017-10-26 12:31:29	jcioffi	and thanks @tweninger, so far things have been pretty interesting! I couldn't get into the free lunch :/ it is free but ticketed and they ran out of tickets
2017-10-26 12:33:52	tweninger	And by dinner I mean the random dinners with random attendees
2017-10-26 12:35:12	jcioffi	lol
2017-10-26 12:35:23	jcioffi	guess I'll have to start making more friends

2017-10-26 13:18:34	jeffrey	He just didn't want the shame of mentioning keenan
2017-10-26 13:18:36	jbaker10	Just saw @dchiang and bus fam in he DH :D
2017-10-26 13:18:43	ssjohns	Asking now. Will try and get stuff by the end of the day. Is this supposed to be a panel of some sort?

2017-10-26 13:19:49	jbaker10	The children are super cute
2017-10-26 13:19:55	dchiang	Why don't you say hi instead of stalking
2017-10-26 13:20:04	jbaker10	Because you were putting your tray away!

2017-10-26 13:26:19	pbui	@tweninger: i gave your child some candy, you're welcome
2017-10-26 13:27:31	tweninger	thanks! you're the best! ask him about the countries in south america - stand back and be amazed
2017-10-26 13:28:54	pbui	lol, i did, and he told me that french guinea used to be part of brazil

2017-10-26 14:34:19	jeffrey	I finally switched to powershell when forced to use windows, because it has `ls`
2017-10-26 14:34:49	jeffrey	i wonder how much of the gnu userland I can run in windows
2017-10-26 14:34:57	pbui	"Many of my classmates had decided to take ECE391 - a course offered by the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering which was primarily known for its final project: a basic multitasking operating system."
2017-10-26 14:34:59	pbui	...
2017-10-26 14:35:01	pbui	dayum
2017-10-26 14:35:21	jeffrey	it's not too late to make that the final project
2017-10-26 14:35:35	jeffrey	actually, make the final project "contribute to basekernel" pls
2017-10-26 14:35:39	pbui	lol
2017-10-26 14:35:54	pbui	i think it will be either iso image tools, or gfs
2017-10-26 14:35:57	pbui	probably gfs
2017-10-26 14:36:11	jeffrey	if you did iso image tool
2017-10-26 14:36:19	jeffrey	you could do "make a bootable basekernel image"
2017-10-26 14:36:25	jeffrey	bc right now we don't have one
2017-10-26 14:36:34	jeffrey	(well, one that works on real hardware anyway)
2017-10-26 14:37:01	pbui	"ToaruOS's kernel in its current form is 32-bit, non-SMP, monolithic (but modular), and Unix-like. It supports processes, threads, shared memory, files, pipes, TTYs, packet-based IPC, and basic IPv4 networking. "
2017-10-26 14:37:07	pbui	already light years ahead of basekernel
2017-10-26 14:37:27	pbui	hmm
2017-10-26 14:37:31	pbui	maybe i can consider that
2017-10-26 14:37:37	pbui	make a bootable iso image
2017-10-26 14:38:36	jeffrey	"already" a project years older doesn't count as "already"
2017-10-26 14:40:05	pbui	it even supports python and vim
2017-10-26 14:42:43	jeffrey	I am now installing MinGW
2017-10-26 14:43:07	jeffrey	I already have vim in my powershell
2017-10-26 14:43:11	jeffrey	and python3
2017-10-26 14:48:18	pbui	y not the subsystem?
2017-10-26 14:49:19	jeffrey	need gpu support for tensorflow
2017-10-26 14:50:22	jeffrey	actually... can I buy that GT710 from lug?
2017-10-26 14:50:30	jeffrey	Then I could do GPU passthrough
2017-10-26 14:50:39	jeffrey	I guess I could also just drive to bestbuy
2017-10-26 14:51:20	pbui	if it is not doing anything
2017-10-26 14:51:22	pbui	u can use it
2017-10-26 14:51:25	pbui	on loan
2017-10-26 14:52:46	jeffrey	If I installed, say, arch on one of my hard drive partitions and got everything working, copying the partition over to my SSD should be painless, right?
2017-10-26 14:53:01	pbui	yes
2017-10-26 14:53:04	pbui	theoretically
2017-10-26 15:04:51	jeffrey	... accidentally named script `keras.py`, then couldn't import keras

2017-10-26 15:20:54	jeffrey	I might switch from an RNN to a CNN, since the internet says it will train faster
2017-10-26 15:27:18	pbui	try this on a student machine: `~pbui/pub/bin/ponysay ZOMG`
2017-10-26 15:29:53	jeffrey	neat
2017-10-26 15:30:07	pbui	did it work?
2017-10-26 15:30:23	jeffrey	yeah
2017-10-26 15:31:58	pbui	gonna use it for systems next semester
2017-10-26 15:32:00	pbui	fo sho
2017-10-26 15:54:08	a3qz	make that like

2017-10-26 16:25:37	jeffrey	anyone know how to make keras show false positive / false negative rate?
2017-10-26 16:30:22	mflanag6	ask politely
2017-10-26 16:31:58	jeffrey	Also, contributing to basekernel and the ndlug blog got me a shirt, ya'll should do the same
2017-10-26 16:32:45	pbui	apparently can contribute to ur own repo
2017-10-26 16:32:51	pbui	this was not well thought out

2017-10-26 16:33:38	pbui	voidlinux got a lot of PRs lol
2017-10-26 16:39:00	jeffrey	The cost of policing probably outweighs the cost of the shirts
2017-10-26 16:43:05	pbui	yeah
2017-10-26 17:07:40	walter.scheirer	my favorite part of this hotel i'm staying at is the italian cookies the maid leaves me each evening
2017-10-26 17:08:18	walter.scheirer	@tweninger: you are absolutely right about random conversations at conference banquets
2017-10-26 17:08:34	walter.scheirer	i just had one right now, and I think Adobe may be willing to throw us some money for the Vatican project
2017-10-26 17:13:49	pbui	@pbui uploaded a file: IMG_20171026_171211503.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0HK21CP2/F7QN0MUUU/img_20171026_171211503.jpg  and commented: Halloween family night at the snite
2017-10-26 17:15:53	walter.scheirer	the snite... almost as good as the biennale
2017-10-26 17:47:45	walter.scheirer	woh, i just read up
2017-10-26 17:47:48	walter.scheirer	that reddit poster...
2017-10-26 17:47:50	walter.scheirer	spectacular
2017-10-26 17:48:04	walter.scheirer	i'm looking forward to that event
2017-10-26 17:48:11	tweninger	I'll pass along your wow to my graphic designer
2017-10-26 18:47:40	jeffrey	I found the first spider in my room all year
2017-10-26 18:48:15	8bit	you make it sound like that's a good thing
2017-10-26 18:50:17	jeffrey	I mean, 1 per semester is pretty good
2017-10-26 18:50:36	jeffrey	And it's a little one
2017-10-26 18:51:10	jeffrey	Freshman year a big one crawled out of my pillow so I spent finals week sleeping in the Stanford basement
2017-10-26 18:56:59	8bit	that is adequately terrifying, but I'm not sure the basement is ever a better option
2017-10-26 19:06:25	jeffrey	My RA was like, "John, you can't keep sleeping on the couch down there. There are more spiders there than in your bed."
2017-10-26 19:10:36	jeffrey	good news, my LSTM model is 96% accurate
2017-10-26 19:10:57	jeffrey	bad news, one category appears 96% of the time, and it basically always guesses that one
2017-10-26 19:22:55	ssjohns	@tweninger When do you need the description by? Our community people are working on it now.

2017-10-26 21:18:32	pbui	u mad bro?
2017-10-26 21:21:53	jeffrey	very
2017-10-26 21:22:50	pbui	this isnt what you didnt vote for
2017-10-26 21:48:40	tweninger	what is 8bits email address?
2017-10-26 21:51:28	ccarball	tweninger: he just pm'ed you
2017-10-26 22:42:48	pbui	"Finally, what is your take on the removal of the Daily Stormer website by various technology services? How do you feel about companies removing Nazi, fascist, or Alt-Right affliated content from online platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit? Are you concerned about online censorship? Why or why not?
2017-10-26 22:43:01	pbui	next week in ethics should be interesting
2017-10-26 23:13:06	jeffrey	I am concerned with online censorship
2017-10-26 23:36:15	jcioffi	@catvajiac @ccarball thanks girls :)
2017-10-27 09:47:17	walter.scheirer	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html?smid=tw-nytimes&smtyp=cur https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/us/reddit-violence-policy.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur 
2017-10-27 09:47:52	pbui	yep, that is the topic for next week
2017-10-27 09:48:19	walter.scheirer	i don't think this is censorship or a crackdown on free speech
2017-10-27 09:48:24	walter.scheirer	reddit is a private company
2017-10-27 09:48:26	walter.scheirer	not the government
2017-10-27 09:48:28	pbui	is ready to find the alt-right sympathizers in our midsts
2017-10-27 09:48:42	walter.scheirer	i'd be concerned if the government were cracking down
2017-10-27 09:49:00	pbui	im still concerned if private companies are censoring
2017-10-27 09:49:12	pbui	it's obviously not the same as the government
2017-10-27 09:57:42	androidkitkat	@walter.scheirer i feel the same way kinda, like its their site and they can do with it as they please
2017-10-27 09:58:06	androidkitkat	but then again censoring
2017-10-27 10:00:32	pbui	i think reddit is more understandable than say cloudflare
2017-10-27 10:00:40	pbui	or even godaddy
2017-10-27 10:01:28	pbui	even in the case of reddit though, it's more about their hypocrisy
2017-10-27 10:01:50	pbui	they claim to be all about the open internet and have tolerated many despicable things in the past
2017-10-27 10:02:29	pbui	are they a platform for open communication as they said they are, or only for certain tolerated speech
2017-10-27 10:02:45	pbui	will they ban BLM or antifa subreddits if they promote violence?
2017-10-27 10:02:58	androidkitkat	are there BLM or antifa subs?
2017-10-27 10:03:06	pbui	im sure there are
2017-10-27 10:03:10	wtheisen	I mean it's pretty obvious which way reddit leans
2017-10-27 10:03:14	androidkitkat	^
2017-10-27 10:03:20	wtheisen	It's super bad in the past year or so
2017-10-27 10:03:43	wtheisen	I had to unsubscribe from like half the subs I had because they became so cancerous
2017-10-27 10:03:54	androidkitkat	which?
2017-10-27 10:04:04	wtheisen	Pretty much 100% of the default subs
2017-10-27 10:04:15	wtheisen	Almost everything you see on r/all
2017-10-27 10:04:23	androidkitkat	the default subs are pretty bad kinda
2017-10-27 10:04:33	androidkitkat	isnt twox a default?
2017-10-27 10:04:49	wtheisen	they're horrendous, r/politics is actually such a shithole now
2017-10-27 10:05:50	androidkitkat	im also surprised by a lot of subs that will ban you if you've posted on T_D
2017-10-27 10:06:07	androidkitkat	i think thats against the rules of reddit but i have to read up
2017-10-27 10:07:24	pbui	r/aww is a bastion of liberalism
2017-10-27 10:07:24	pbui	r/linux is full of hippies
2017-10-27 10:07:24	pbui	"open source", "free software"
2017-10-27 10:07:24	pbui	sounds like communism to me
2017-10-27 10:07:26	pbui	androidkitkat: that's what i mean, that seems like hivemind groupthink
2017-10-27 10:07:38	pbui	that's not open dialogue and tolerance
2017-10-27 10:07:42	androidkitkat	reddit is full of echo chambers
2017-10-27 10:07:47	wtheisen	yeah it's awful
2017-10-27 10:07:53	androidkitkat	wait @pbui did
2017-10-27 10:08:03	androidkitkat	you just say /r/aww is a bastion of liberalism
2017-10-27 10:08:19	pbui	isnt that the subreddit w/ animal pictures?
2017-10-27 10:08:24	androidkitkat	yes
2017-10-27 10:08:24	pbui	i never go there
2017-10-27 10:08:26	pbui	lol
2017-10-27 10:08:34	androidkitkat	a "bastion of liberalism"
2017-10-27 10:08:40	pbui	yeah, i was trolling wtheisen
2017-10-27 10:08:47	androidkitkat	that makes sense
2017-10-27 10:09:11	pbui	actually r/news is more even handed
2017-10-27 10:09:32	pbui	like if u read the comments, there will be people who explain the nuance of situations
2017-10-27 10:09:44	wtheisen	It's more the fact that they won't recognize that they're biased, that pisses me off more than the fact that they're biased
2017-10-27 10:09:47	pbui	r/politics is basically "trump gonna be impeached real soon now"
2017-10-27 10:09:50	wtheisen	I don't care, just admit it
2017-10-27 10:09:58	androidkitkat	News is pretty bad imo
2017-10-27 10:10:15	pbui	goes to r/politics everyday
2017-10-27 10:10:16	androidkitkat	It's only important if it makes it /r/all and even then
2017-10-27 10:10:16	wtheisen	twox is muh patriarchy spook
2017-10-27 10:11:17	androidkitkat	Let's start our own open platform for discussion
2017-10-27 10:11:21	wtheisen	voat
2017-10-27 10:11:22	wtheisen	kek
2017-10-27 10:11:26	wtheisen	absolute cancer
2017-10-27 10:11:41	androidkitkat	Isn't voat where a bunch of TD went when spez pissed them kdd
2017-10-27 10:11:43	pbui	voat is "clinton gonna go to jail real soon now"
2017-10-27 10:11:43	androidkitkat	Off
2017-10-27 10:11:56	wtheisen	yeah voat is even more trash than reddit
2017-10-27 10:12:03	pbui	they do have systemd haters though...
2017-10-27 10:12:10	androidkitkat	A la dumpster fire
2017-10-27 10:12:36	pbui	i find it strange that my position on systemd puts me in the company of conspiracy theorists
2017-10-27 10:12:48	wtheisen	4chan is the last true great place :stuck_out_tongue:
2017-10-27 10:13:03	8bit	you don't swear off systemd because they're watching you?
2017-10-27 10:15:38	pbui	a number of systemd haters believe it's a conspiracy by the NSA to put a backdoor on linux machines
2017-10-27 10:15:47	pbui	b/c redhat works w/ the NSA
2017-10-27 10:16:04	pbui	NSA funded and created significant portions of SELINUX
2017-10-27 10:16:17	pbui	and redhat/fedora are the only linux distros that come w/ it by default
2017-10-27 10:16:23	androidkitkat	Muh NSA
2017-10-27 10:16:32	pbui	so people have speculated that redhat is in the pocket of the NSA
2017-10-27 10:16:52	androidkitkat	Totally
2017-10-27 10:17:00	pbui	i hate systemd b/c it's overengineered and terrible
2017-10-27 10:17:06	pbui	not b/c i think it's a backdoor
2017-10-27 10:17:09	androidkitkat	Batrick loves the NSA
2017-10-27 10:17:19	pbui	batrick is a hypocrite
2017-10-27 10:17:37	androidkitkat	In what way?
2017-10-27 10:17:39	pbui	he whines and moans about government surveillance but then gives all the things to google
2017-10-27 10:17:51	pbui	he's just as bad as you when it comes to lockin
2017-10-27 10:18:03	androidkitkat	But Google loves me
2017-10-27 10:18:07	androidkitkat	Google wouldn't hurt me
2017-10-27 10:18:23	pbui	in his libertarian mind: gov bad, companies good
2017-10-27 10:18:40	pbui	like if anything is bad, it's b/c the government is involved
2017-10-27 10:18:45	pbui	if the government is involved, it's bad
2017-10-27 10:18:52	androidkitkat	Roads?
2017-10-27 10:19:03	androidkitkat	Well tbf roads are pretty meh quality
2017-10-27 10:19:14	pbui	thinks about potholes on douglas
2017-10-27 10:19:18	androidkitkat	Esp in Illinois where there's always construction for the crap roads
2017-10-27 10:19:32	pbui	illinois is really bad
2017-10-27 10:19:36	pbui	CLASS TIME
2017-10-27 10:19:46	androidkitkat	Be a good teach
2017-10-27 12:58:47	jeffrey	@pbui know an easy way to change filenames of the form `good[0-9].cminor` to `good1[0-9].cminor`, besides writing a simple shell script that would do it very easily?
2017-10-27 13:02:47	jeffrey	ok, my parser works on like 70 test cases
2017-10-27 13:05:21	pbui	@jeffrey: u can do a for loop inline in the shell, or use the `rename` command
2017-10-27 13:15:53	jeffrey	for loop in the shell counts as simple shell script, and i'm lazy
2017-10-27 13:17:18	jeffrey	also I realized that it isn't as simple as add a 1, what I really need is "add 10"
2017-10-27 13:17:25	jeffrey	and then "add 16"
2017-10-27 13:17:43	jeffrey	so rename seems not enough
2017-10-27 13:17:58	jeffrey	anyway, I was lazy and just made 3 folders
2017-10-27 13:34:18	jeffrey	"oh, hey, I can use > in powershell"
2017-10-27 13:34:32	jeffrey	"oh, it actually created a file, neat!"

2017-10-27 14:06:37	wmarkley	@walter.scheirer the Michael Hayden talk was very cool
2017-10-27 14:06:45	walter.scheirer	nice!
2017-10-27 14:06:51	walter.scheirer	i'm upset that i missed it
2017-10-27 14:07:41	wmarkley	He gave his opinions without a filter since he’s retired, or at least I thought so
2017-10-27 14:08:03	wmarkley	So we really heard the insider’s perspective
2017-10-27 14:08:12	walter.scheirer	did he address leaking?
2017-10-27 14:14:12	wmarkley	Yes, he talked about the Snowden incidence
2017-10-27 14:14:20	wmarkley	No recent leaking though
2017-10-27 14:55:10	androidkitkat	paradigms is a good class

2017-10-27 15:27:22	androidkitkat	like signal the messaging platform?
2017-10-27 15:27:35	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-10-27 15:27:41	androidkitkat	weird
2017-10-27 15:27:58	androidkitkat	i dont use it that much any more, but odd
2017-10-27 15:48:43	pbui	Needed to install backdoor
2017-10-27 16:19:10	androidkitkat	you got it
2017-10-27 16:47:11	wtheisen	ugh I think they locked compilers submissions an hour early
2017-10-27 16:47:13	wtheisen	RIP
2017-10-27 16:47:47	jeffrey	daylight savings came early
2017-10-27 16:48:03	jcioffi	that’s no bueno
2017-10-27 16:48:19	jeffrey	zip it and email it to thain
2017-10-27 16:48:23	wtheisen	can u access the directory @jeffrey? I get some weird git error permission stuff when I try to copy
2017-10-27 16:48:28	jeffrey	git?
2017-10-27 16:48:33	wtheisen	I just put it in a public direcoty
2017-10-27 16:48:37	wtheisen	yeah git

2017-10-27 16:49:04	wtheisen	you can copy to it?
2017-10-27 16:49:18	jeffrey	I can make files in it
2017-10-27 16:49:23	wtheisen	wtf
2017-10-27 16:49:54	jeffrey	are you cping or mving?
2017-10-27 16:50:00	wtheisen	cp'ing
2017-10-27 16:50:07	jeffrey	what is your exact error?
2017-10-27 16:50:28	wtheisen	cp: cannot create regular file `/afs/nd.edu/coursefa.17/cse/cse40243.01/dropbox/wtheisen/parser2/compilers/.git/objects/pack/pack-46319140f8fe0e9a244157913ca9f453bf96665c.pack': Permission denied

2017-10-27 16:50:47	jeffrey	ls the directory you are copying to
2017-10-27 16:50:48	wtheisen	it worked the first time, but I can't re-do it
2017-10-27 16:51:06	jeffrey	because you shouldn't need to copy the .git folder
2017-10-27 16:51:16	wtheisen	I don't even have a .git folder
2017-10-27 16:51:25	jeffrey	it thinks you do
2017-10-27 16:51:32	wtheisen	how would fix that?
2017-10-27 16:51:35	wtheisen	I
2017-10-27 16:51:39	jeffrey	idk, `rm -rf .git`?
2017-10-27 16:52:05	wtheisen	tried it, nothing
2017-10-27 16:52:27	jeffrey	what command are you running to cp, exactly?
2017-10-27 16:52:42	wtheisen	cp -r compilers/parser/* /afs/nd.edu/coursefa.17/cse/cse4024

2017-10-27 16:53:06	jeffrey	is there a .git in compilers/parser?
2017-10-27 16:53:12	wtheisen	no
2017-10-27 16:53:27	jeffrey	does compilers/parser have multiple directories?
2017-10-27 16:53:36	wtheisen	yeah, hence the -r
2017-10-27 16:53:47	wtheisen	wouldn't the rm -rf .git have taken care of that though
2017-10-27 16:54:15	wtheisen	also why it would have worked the first time, but not any subsquent time
2017-10-27 16:54:30	jeffrey	not sure
2017-10-27 16:54:39	wtheisen	Well hopefully emailing him was enough
2017-10-27 16:55:27	wtheisen	wait a terrible time for this to happen
2017-10-27 16:55:56	jeffrey	ikr
2017-10-27 16:57:14	wtheisen	okay  figured it out RIP
2017-10-27 16:57:17	wtheisen	thank goodness
2017-10-27 16:58:04	jeffrey	what was it?
2017-10-27 16:58:36	wtheisen	there was a .git in a subfolder
2017-10-27 16:58:51	jeffrey	rip
2017-10-27 16:59:22	wtheisen	dunno why the rm -rf .git didn't pick it up
2017-10-27 17:35:35	pbui	@tweninger: did it!

2017-10-28 12:10:55	wtheisen	Gotcha, and to determine an advisor it's best to read through some of their publications right?

2017-10-28 18:01:07	flynn	The personal contact in advance of the formal app is one of the most important pieces of leverage you can exert. Create an advocate inside the department and your chances go way up.
2017-10-28 18:58:16	walter.scheirer	Just landed and checked the score
2017-10-28 18:58:18	walter.scheirer	Wooo
2017-10-28 18:59:12	walter.scheirer	Wimbush out though
2017-10-28 19:03:50	flynn	Limping
2017-10-28 19:04:33	flynn	But still playing.  Not sure why give the lead.
2017-10-28 19:10:44	walter.scheirer	Wow, penn state osu definitely the better game
2017-10-28 19:16:59	flynn	Holy crap unranked N’western took down the Spartans in 3OT
2017-10-28 19:26:35	walter.scheirer	Ouch
2017-10-28 19:26:48	walter.scheirer	Lots of good games today
2017-10-28 19:27:42	walter.scheirer	That makes our win against them slightly less exciting
2017-10-28 19:47:00	flynn	Sparty-world is now full of angst. They almost lost to IU last week as well.

2017-10-28 20:47:23	walter.scheirer	A good statement should clearly state what you want to work on and why

2017-10-28 21:08:10	walter.scheirer	:+1:
2017-10-28 21:08:59	wtheisen	@walter.scheirer should I email you beforehand to try and get an advocate in the department on my side?
2017-10-28 22:21:32	jeffrey	Very helpful discussions here today, thanks fam
2017-10-28 22:22:24	walter.scheirer	@wtheisen (and anyone else applying to grad school): I’m happy to meet you in person to chat about grad apps
2017-10-28 22:27:02	jeffrey	Would it help to change my name to "et al" if I don't have any publications?
2017-10-28 22:53:17	dchiang	I didn't have any publications
2017-10-28 22:54:07	dchiang	My theory is that it is not as important for US students from good universities
2017-10-28 22:57:12	bdevorem	@wtheisen I went to a grad admissions workshop a few days ago at oopsla and the profs there told the undergrads that they really care about sops and recs. More specifically how you talk about your past research (or experiences that led you to want to go into research in a particular field, but not childhood stuff, more like courses or internships) in your sop.
2017-10-28 23:38:40	walter.scheirer	Different PIs are going to look at different things
2017-10-28 23:39:41	walter.scheirer	Papers help a lot
2017-10-28 23:40:08	walter.scheirer	Not necessarily required, as @dchiang points out

2017-10-29 12:02:45	flynn	Happy to help, and also happy to talk about the grad admissions process - keep in mind that faculty are pretty independent agents in the process and have their own ways to evaluate excellence (as shown by the comments above).
2017-10-29 13:38:08	walter.scheirer	http://limn.it/preface-hacks-leaks-and-breaches/ 
2017-10-29 14:30:38	flynn	Great article. Quote: “Not since the 1990s has “the cyber” seen so much grammatically-challenged love.”   :joy:
2017-10-29 14:38:25	flynn	Apropos of nothing: MSU owned a CDC Cyber 750 in the late 70s and 80s and all the CS majors used it for basically everything except the first programming course (which used the Apple II for Pascal programming). We called it “the Cyber”. https://archive.org/details/bitsavers_cdccybercy750BrochureApr79_1447680 
2017-10-29 14:38:44	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-10-29 15:57:28	pbui	speaking of leaks, that page walter.scheirer linked causes firefox to allocate 39GB of RAM and maxes all 4 threads on my CPU
2017-10-29 15:57:30	pbui	wtf
2017-10-29 15:57:37	pbui	my laptop sounds like a 747
2017-10-29 15:57:42	walter.scheirer	pwned
2017-10-29 15:57:44	walter.scheirer	by my link
2017-10-29 15:57:57	pbui	this sounds like a DOS
2017-10-29 16:34:46	ewilli23	39gb of ram?
2017-10-29 16:34:56	ewilli23	Heap overflow should be a thing
2017-10-29 16:35:11	pbui	os lies
2017-10-29 16:35:22	pbui	oh u need more memory? sure thing
2017-10-29 16:35:24	pbui	:]
2017-10-29 16:42:00	ewilli23	Yeah at some point the os should be like “you’ve had enough, I think it’s time to go home”
2017-10-29 16:42:05	ewilli23	!closing time
2017-10-29 16:42:05	bobbit	@ewilli23: So gather up your jackets, and move it to the exits // I hope you have found a friend.
2017-10-29 16:42:26	pbui	wow, an appropriate use of a song lyric
2017-10-29 16:42:33	pbui	impressive
2017-10-29 16:45:01	walter.scheirer	heap overflow is a thing...
2017-10-29 16:45:49	ewilli23	At what point does it become a thing
2017-10-29 16:46:01	ewilli23	Like how much memory is too much
2017-10-29 16:46:18	walter.scheirer	slightly different context --- when you allocate memory on the heap, but write beyond that allocation
2017-10-29 16:48:00	pbui	right, but ewilli23 is talking about asking for too much heap space
2017-10-29 16:48:08	pbui	so overflow is the the correct term
2017-10-29 16:51:29	flynn	I prefer “heap exhaustion”… it’s a lot of work allocating all of that and the CPU gets all tired and sweaty; that’s why the fan goes on
2017-10-29 16:51:42	walter.scheirer	http://coldattic.info/shvedsky/pro/blogs/a-foo-walks-into-a-bar/posts/40 
2017-10-29 16:51:47	walter.scheirer	some interesting thoughts on this ---
2017-10-29 16:51:48	pbui	err i meant overflow is the incorrect term
2017-10-29 16:52:04	walter.scheirer	folks tend to jump to ulimit, which doesn't work...
2017-10-29 16:53:02	pbui	i think cgroups does real resource accounting on linux these days
2017-10-29 16:53:12	pbui	b/c yes, ulimits does not work
2017-10-29 16:53:20	pbui	we ran into this for cctools in dthain's group
2017-10-29 16:53:29	walter.scheirer	cgroups predates that post
2017-10-29 16:53:36	walter.scheirer	i wonder if it has gotten better
2017-10-29 16:54:00	pbui	but i dont think it was mature enough to be used in practice yet
2017-10-29 16:54:14	pbui	cgroups is the tech behind the container stuff (ie. docker)
2017-10-29 16:54:20	pbui	one of the techs anyways
2017-10-29 16:54:47	walter.scheirer	interesting
2017-10-29 16:54:51	pbui	like w/ systemd, u can specify containers w/ particular resource contraints
2017-10-29 16:56:17	pbui	https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html 
2017-10-29 16:56:26	flynn	In the future, will every user-facing app be running in its own container?
2017-10-29 16:56:40	pbui	that's basically the case in mobile
2017-10-29 16:56:50	pbui	on the desktop... it's getting there
2017-10-29 16:57:09	pbui	i think windows store and the apple store have some of those restrictions
2017-10-29 16:57:24	pbui	on the linux side, snap and flatpak are basically containers
2017-10-29 16:58:50	pbui	here is an example of someone using docker for most of their desktop apps: https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/docker-containers-on-the-desktop/ 
2017-10-29 17:00:07	alitteke	I think Apple tried to do container stuff with the Mac App Store, but it didn’t go super well for them so far, the developers don’t want to create stuff for the OS in that way https://developer.apple.com/app-sandboxing/ 
2017-10-29 17:02:35	pbui	i think the app stores are pushing it, but the devs are not buying it
2017-10-29 17:02:38	pbui	on the desktop anyways
2017-10-29 17:05:56	pbui	im sort of on the fence about docker and containers
2017-10-29 17:06:01	jbaker10	Have we ever thought about participating in https://localhackday.mlh.io/ ?
2017-10-29 17:06:17	jbaker10	asking for a friend. I would never :wink:
2017-10-29 17:06:44	pbui	this is the first ive heard of it
2017-10-29 17:08:34	pbui	Deadline for swag: We'll need all your information on the Organizer Dashboard before November 1st.
2017-10-29 17:08:45	pbui	@jbaker10: u have 3 days to organize it
2017-10-29 17:09:05	jbaker10	Organize? who? me?
2017-10-29 17:09:43	pbui	tbh, though, while i think it is great, i feel there are too many hackathons
2017-10-29 17:10:06	pbui	like i've had students go to 3-4 of these already
2017-10-29 17:10:29	pbui	which is fine, students are free to do as they wish, but i feel like they are being stretched thin
2017-10-29 17:10:39	pbui	w/ all these different activities
2017-10-29 17:12:51	jbaker10	+1
2017-10-29 17:13:08	pbui	how many have you done jbaker10 ?
2017-10-29 17:13:11	pbui	at least 2/
2017-10-29 17:13:18	pbui	?
2017-10-29 17:14:26	jbaker10	I've done exactly 1 in my entire life
2017-10-29 17:14:40	pbui	ATT
2017-10-29 17:14:43	jbaker10	i'm 1/1 in victories. maybe i should retire
2017-10-29 17:14:47	pbui	u didnt do the google one?
2017-10-29 17:14:55	pbui	i guess that wasnt technically a hackathon
2017-10-29 17:15:00	jbaker10	that wasn't a hackathon, that was a fun puzzle thing
2017-10-29 17:15:21	dougsmith	Can we sponsor a local fun puzzle thing instead?
2017-10-29 17:16:40	pbui	w/ what time
2017-10-29 17:17:46	pbui	@jbaker10: id rather people sign up and volunteer to help out w/ hour of code at local michiana schools
2017-10-29 17:18:16	pbui	https://hourofcode.com/us 
2017-10-29 17:26:07	jbaker10	I tried teaching high schoolers :(
2017-10-29 17:28:45	dougsmith	Did it not go well?
2017-10-29 17:35:45	jbaker10	Oh it went fine. I had a few students really enjoy having me giving them opportunities to go ahead. Many of them just wanted a good grade for the sake of college apps
2017-10-29 19:06:58	jeffrey	#5 bois let's gooo

2017-10-30 14:36:20	flynn	If you're too productive, your recovery causes your average productivity to go down. Counter-productive productivity.
2017-10-30 14:36:34	dougsmith	walter.scheirer: why would any of us want to free(time). I worked hard for this and I'm not giving it back to the OS
2017-10-30 14:36:46	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-10-30 14:36:54	cshinave	_sigh_
2017-10-30 14:37:31	cshinave	I try to not show off Linux knowledge at work. Otherwise I'll get moved to ops
2017-10-30 14:37:37	cshinave	And NO ONE wants to be on ops
2017-10-30 14:38:37	cshinave	Currently I work like ~8 hours. Which is nice
2017-10-30 14:38:46	cshinave	Most have call, which is rough
2017-10-30 14:38:58	cshinave	My friend has been out of town for work for 24 days this month
2017-10-30 14:39:04	cshinave	And we have the same job lol
2017-10-30 14:39:22	jeffrey	this algs homework is simultaneously the easiest and hardest
2017-10-30 14:40:05	cshinave	"solve(); implementation left as an exercise to the reader"
2017-10-30 14:40:21	cshinave	Gg git gud
2017-10-30 14:40:36	dougsmith	cshinave: is that the solution? Please tell me that's the solution.
2017-10-30 14:40:51	cshinave	It is if you're an academic writing textbooks
2017-10-30 14:41:00	dougsmith	_closes book, leaves room whistling_
2017-10-30 14:41:54	flynn	@flynn uploaded a file: CNN home page has this breaking news item: https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U3VAZJ9L6/F7T2U6HBQ/pasted_image_at_2017_10_30_02_41_pm.png 
2017-10-30 14:42:29	jeffrey	"Here we show that P=NP. Consider an NP-Complete problem K. There exists a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that solves K. Therefore, P = NP. Polynomial time solution for K left as an exercise for the reader."
2017-10-30 14:42:40	cshinave	honestly though
2017-10-30 14:42:52	cshinave	That is some of the most frustrating crap
2017-10-30 14:43:25	cshinave	Luckily CLRS doesn't do it often
2017-10-30 14:53:09	cshinave	@jeffrey are people using the lug repo?
2017-10-30 14:53:15	cshinave	I keep getting emails
2017-10-30 14:53:27	cshinave	Or blog posts. That'd be cool too
2017-10-30 14:53:29	jeffrey	we are hosting github pages in it
2017-10-30 14:53:33	cshinave	Ah
2017-10-30 14:53:37	jeffrey	for the blog
2017-10-30 14:53:46	jeffrey	since dmattia took the VPS with him when he left
2017-10-30 14:54:04	cshinave	Thief
2017-10-30 14:54:24	cshinave	@dmattia u still alive?
2017-10-30 14:55:06	cshinave	Gonna take that as a nope
2017-10-30 14:56:04	jeffrey	i mean, it was his
2017-10-30 14:57:12	cshinave	Ik, I'm kidding
2017-10-30 14:57:18	cshinave	I was curious how job life was
2017-10-30 14:57:53	cshinave	I haven't heard from many people
2017-10-30 14:58:01	cshinave	Only some of my close friends
2017-10-30 14:59:59	catvajiac	cshinave: can confirm that he was alive as of this weekend
2017-10-30 15:00:04	catvajiac	he's not on here all the time anymore tho
2017-10-30 15:00:50	cshinave	Figured
2017-10-30 15:00:57	cshinave	Is he at google?
2017-10-30 15:01:06	catvajiac	yep
2017-10-30 15:01:21	cshinave	Cool cool
2017-10-30 18:01:17	wtheisen	Any reasons why my friends can ssh into a machine, but I can't on bot my PC and laptop? Nor can I even view the site in browser?
2017-10-30 18:01:41	walter.scheirer	firewall?
2017-10-30 18:02:16	wtheisen	is it possible that would effect both machines? I'm getting a cannot resolve hostname
2017-10-30 18:02:24	walter.scheirer	oh, that's DNS
2017-10-30 18:02:32	wtheisen	yeah that's what I figured
2017-10-30 18:02:37	walter.scheirer	did that change recently?
2017-10-30 18:02:46	walter.scheirer	could be a propagation problem
2017-10-30 18:02:53	wtheisen	I suppose so, DNS is my mortal bane
2017-10-30 18:02:57	walter.scheirer	which should resolve in a few hours
2017-10-30 18:03:12	walter.scheirer	if you know the machine's IP, you can test
2017-10-30 18:03:29	wtheisen	but why would everyone else be able to access it but me? Even on both  my machines
2017-10-30 18:03:45	jeffrey	what's the url?
2017-10-30 18:03:49	walter.scheirer	that can happen with DNS propagation
2017-10-30 18:03:53	wtheisen	group02.dhcp.nd.edu 
2017-10-30 18:04:09	jeffrey	loads for me but is insecure
2017-10-30 18:04:13	walter.scheirer	ditto
2017-10-30 18:04:14	wtheisen	I have my vpn turned off and I'm on eduroam
2017-10-30 18:04:17	wtheisen	argh
2017-10-30 18:04:30	walter.scheirer	$ telnet group02.dhcp.nd.edu  22
2017-10-30 18:04:30	walter.scheirer	Trying 10.173.222.96...

2017-10-30 18:05:10	wtheisen	Hah that IP worked
2017-10-30 18:05:13	wtheisen	thanks for that
2017-10-30 18:05:22	wtheisen	I couldn't get that either
2017-10-30 18:05:36	wtheisen	thanks so much @walter.scheirer
2017-10-30 18:06:25	wtheisen	so because the IP works that means it's almost definitely a DNS prop issue then?
2017-10-30 18:07:13	walter.scheirer	that would be my guess
2017-10-30 18:07:43	wtheisen	that's weird that it can effect different groups like that
2017-10-30 21:24:53	walter.scheirer	hmm... it seems i still need to switch my talk with somebody, since i will be in kentucky on weds.
2017-10-30 21:25:11	walter.scheirer	anybody?
2017-10-30 21:25:22	pbui	wat
2017-10-30 21:25:25	pbui	how could u
2017-10-30 21:25:37	pbui	@androidkitkat: it's your moment to shine

2017-10-30 21:40:32	androidkitkat	I use a web client
2017-10-30 21:40:40	androidkitkat	I could try to get a Linux client

2017-10-30 21:43:37	walter.scheirer	how to configure a markov babbler bot
2017-10-30 21:43:38	androidkitkat	Bounce you can only get after 30 days
2017-10-30 21:43:47	androidkitkat	Although you can do your own ZNC
2017-10-30 21:43:48	pbui	still, explain the concept
2017-10-30 21:44:01	pbui	pretend we are noobs

2017-10-30 21:44:40	pbui	we only trust the other big tech monopoly
2017-10-30 21:44:47	pbui	maybe libreoffic
2017-10-30 21:44:52	pbui	j/k, we dont judge
2017-10-30 21:44:58	androidkitkat	What about Apple KeyNote
2017-10-30 21:45:00	pbui	if u need to use non-free software
2017-10-30 21:45:02	pbui	then so be it

2017-10-30 22:04:55	pbui	u stand in front of people and pretend to know what u are talking about
2017-10-30 22:05:17	pbui	@alitteke: gj w/ the editting the episode was better than i remembered
2017-10-30 22:05:23	pbui	like legitmately
2017-10-30 22:06:09	pbui	@alitteke: @jbaker10 since tomorrow is halloween, maybe we can make the podcast about the "scariest" moments in cs
2017-10-30 22:06:13	pbui	at least for us
2017-10-30 22:06:15	pbui	i dunno
2017-10-30 22:06:18	androidkitkat	@pbui i can do a good job
2017-10-30 22:06:30	pbui	or "trick-or-treat"
2017-10-30 22:06:45	alitteke	what does that mean?
2017-10-30 22:06:52	pbui	true, androidkitkat, u did go to paradigms that one time
2017-10-30 22:07:24	pbui	alitteke: i dunno, but like we can talk about like something we really enjoy about cs and something we really hate
2017-10-30 22:07:27	pbui	or did not enjoy
2017-10-30 22:07:29	pbui	i dunno
2017-10-30 22:07:40	pbui	im just avoiding making another lecture in OS
2017-10-30 22:08:38	pbui	we can talk about the robot apocalypse
2017-10-30 22:08:47	pbui	and if we think automation will take over the world
2017-10-30 22:08:59	pbui	and what CS education can/should do to address that
2017-10-30 22:09:05	androidkitkat	can i talk about the magic of Bluetooth and how the university of mind controlling us
2017-10-30 22:09:11	pbui	this would tie into cs 4 all
2017-10-30 22:09:53	pbui	the university?
2017-10-30 22:09:58	pbui	i thought it was russia?
2017-10-30 22:10:07	androidkitkat	no
2017-10-30 22:10:08	androidkitkat	ND is
2017-10-30 22:10:10	pbui	right wtheisen :ok_hand:
2017-10-30 22:10:19	androidkitkat	everytime i leave a building, bluetooth goes choppy
2017-10-30 22:10:45	androidkitkat	which means its breaking free of the network and transitioning to a different network
2017-10-30 22:11:27	androidkitkat	they want us to love jesus
2017-10-30 22:14:35	androidkitkat	is Thomas Fuja good as a prof
2017-10-30 22:14:51	pbui	dunno
2017-10-30 22:15:18	pbui	maybe the cpegs would know
2017-10-30 22:16:19	androidkitkat	i just need an elective that frehsman can take
2017-10-30 22:16:36	androidkitkat	that is something interesting
2017-10-30 22:16:54	pbui	ive heard that the microprocessor EE course is pretty good
2017-10-30 22:16:59	pbui	i think alitteke took it
2017-10-30 22:17:07	pbui	he mentioned it on the podcast about electives
2017-10-30 22:17:36	androidkitkat	isnt that the one with arduino
2017-10-30 22:17:43	alitteke	Yes
2017-10-30 22:18:03	alitteke	It’s half basic electronics and microprocessors and half matlab audio processing
2017-10-30 22:18:12	pbui	a winning combo
2017-10-30 22:19:18	androidkitkat	thats what a lot of people are taking
2017-10-30 22:19:22	androidkitkat	from what i knwo
2017-10-30 22:20:10	androidkitkat	i just realized i dont have any podcasts app anymore on my android
2017-10-30 22:20:15	pbui	https://blog.mozilla.org/internetcitizen/2017/08/29/do-you-need-a-vpn/ 
2017-10-30 22:20:16	androidkitkat	needs to get one
2017-10-30 22:20:33	alitteke	It’s not the worst class, and it is a different sort of tech elective
2017-10-30 22:21:02	pbui	u should take a history class on vikings or the romans
2017-10-30 22:21:09	pbui	or dark age england
2017-10-30 22:21:25	pbui	or the ftt class involving watching movies
2017-10-30 23:11:31	androidkitkat	@pbui that's. Good idea
2017-10-30 23:12:13	pbui	im serious
2017-10-30 23:12:23	pbui	u will have plenty of time for tech electives
2017-10-30 23:12:26	pbui	do something fun
2017-10-30 23:12:35	pbui	i think jeffrey had a class where he made a boat
2017-10-30 23:12:37	pbui	or something
2017-10-30 23:13:10	walter.scheirer	@jeffrey made a boat???
2017-10-30 23:34:49	jeffrey	I don't recall anything like that
2017-10-30 23:35:04	pbui	werent u in a history class last year?
2017-10-30 23:35:04	jeffrey	It does sound like me though
2017-10-30 23:35:17	pbui	and had to do something like that?
2017-10-30 23:35:24	jeffrey	Last fall, yeah
2017-10-30 23:35:31	jeffrey	I made a game
2017-10-30 23:35:33	pbui	oh
2017-10-30 23:35:39	pbui	that is like a boat
2017-10-30 23:36:07	jeffrey	I wonder if someone else did make a boat.
2017-10-30 23:36:15	jeffrey	Besides for the regatta
2017-10-31 00:19:36	ewilli23	TBH I’d wait to take open-ended electives (e.g. tech electives) until at least sophomore year, unless there’s something that looks really interesting
2017-10-31 00:20:49	ewilli23	Once you start taking prereqs (and once you’re a sophomore and no longer limited to freshman classes) your elective options generally expand and become more interesting
2017-10-31 02:15:21	jbaker10	since when were freshman restricted to taking only freshman classes? did I miss something?
2017-10-31 02:19:07	ewilli23	I mean they can take some 20000 level but there are some that are restricted to sophs+ I think. But more generally for tech electives once you take the fc+ds sequence (for cse classes) and physics and calc for other tech electives a lot more possibilities open up
2017-10-31 02:19:48	jbaker10	well to be fair, all restrictions aren't real. In my experience, there is always a workaround
2017-10-31 02:20:08	jbaker10	it seems like they are put on classes to deter people, but can't stop you
2017-10-31 02:20:39	jbaker10	now, if you've never spoken a word of french, probably not in your best interest to take a purely conversational course in french
2017-10-31 11:59:31	androidkitkat	the powerpoint is making progress
2017-10-31 12:25:21	pbui	yay
2017-10-31 12:31:46	androidkitkat	although i broke my mouse
2017-10-31 12:31:54	walter.scheirer	extreme powerpointing
2017-10-31 12:32:01	androidkitkat	my mouse was broken before
2017-10-31 12:32:11	androidkitkat	i accidently threw it onto the ground
2017-10-31 12:32:14	androidkitkat	very hard

2017-10-31 12:37:23	androidkitkat	thank goodness for lastpass
2017-10-31 12:37:28	8bit	++++++
2017-10-31 12:37:30	silv3r	Sadder than the 20 min wait for abp
2017-10-31 12:37:39	8bit	I was just gonna say _use a password manager_
2017-10-31 12:37:41	silv3r	Where is my avo sandwich
2017-10-31 12:37:51	silv3r	+1
2017-10-31 12:37:56	androidkitkat	lastpass saves the day
2017-10-31 12:37:58	8bit	they probably forgot, you should order another one silv3r
2017-10-31 12:38:06	androidkitkat	order one for me too
2017-10-31 12:38:11	walter.scheirer	all the cool kids are using 1password
2017-10-31 12:38:12	walter.scheirer	:stuck_out_tongue:
2017-10-31 12:38:35	8bit	last pass has been pretty buggy for me recently, I'm open to a new one
2017-10-31 12:38:45	androidkitkat	isnt 1password the one that works really nicely with iOS
2017-10-31 12:38:53	walter.scheirer	1password is not free, but worth the small price
2017-10-31 12:38:55	walter.scheirer	IMHO
2017-10-31 12:39:00	androidkitkat	and just apple in general
2017-10-31 12:39:22	androidkitkat	i just bought a year of lastpass right before the pricehike
2017-10-31 12:39:39	8bit	oh sad it's a subscription
2017-10-31 12:40:00	8bit	i'll have to check it out tho
2017-10-31 12:40:09	androidkitkat	subscriptions suck
2017-10-31 12:40:16	androidkitkat	but it was $12 for a year
2017-10-31 12:45:38	silv3r	@8bit nah it was just super busy
2017-10-31 12:48:20	androidkitkat	@walter.scheirer acutally all the cool kids just remember super complex 20 character passwords
2017-10-31 12:49:20	walter.scheirer	ha

2017-10-31 13:56:48	alitteke	They did say in the keynote even that they can’t guarantee that it wouldn’t produce a false positive on twins
2017-10-31 14:16:11	androidkitkat	@ccarball when can you get the money
2017-10-31 14:16:52	walter.scheirer	now i don't have any incentive to buy a X
2017-10-31 14:19:05	androidkitkat	also what does the reddit meetup entail

2017-10-31 14:26:39	ssjohns	And hardly triumphant, I'm surprised I haven't been fired.
2017-10-31 14:26:55	tweninger	It involves Shaq standing in front of all of you for 50 minutes talking about databases
2017-10-31 14:27:13	tweninger	and then we upvote him
2017-10-31 14:28:05	androidkitkat	thats upvote worthy
2017-10-31 14:42:17	ssjohns	I come to find out I'm getting graded for this speech. I get failed from Fall Databases 2016 if I do badly and have to go back to school.
2017-10-31 14:42:40	ssjohns	"Everytime I'm out, they pull me back in!!!"
2017-10-31 14:45:39	tweninger	shall I dig up your Databases project video?
2017-10-31 14:46:03	tweninger	I think that'd be a good introduction :smile:
2017-10-31 15:23:05	androidkitkat	can anyone bring a USB-C to HDMI/DVI/VGA adapter

2017-10-31 16:06:27	tweninger	I had to go fix his pipes?
2017-10-31 16:06:34	walter.scheirer	haha

2017-10-31 16:54:34	jeffrey	a lot of people are predicting ND will be #3 for the cfp

2017-10-31 20:53:29	jbaker10	Anyone wanna solve a programming question? :D
2017-10-31 21:01:57	jeffrey	Maybe
2017-10-31 21:02:57	jeffrey	Should I be worried if the actual runtime of an O(n^3) algorithm on my computer had a best fit to a cubic, with an R^2 of 1?
2017-10-31 21:15:06	jeffrey	What's your question @jbaker10
2017-10-31 21:22:08	dchiang	Why would that be worrisome?
2017-10-31 21:28:00	jeffrey	I would assume that the timing would have to be off somewhere to make it not exactly 1
2017-10-31 21:29:37	jeffrey	Like, at a certain size maybe I suddenly don't fit in L1 cache or something. Or the timer isn't accurate enough.
2017-10-31 21:36:21	jeffrey	I mean, it it was linear or quartic I'd be more worried

2017-11-01 01:29:18	jeffrey	I assume they want you to clear your cache
2017-11-01 01:38:06	ewilli23	Yeah but then why don’t they say cache
2017-11-01 01:38:43	ewilli23	Also does anyone have a macbook screwdriver they could bring to lug tomorrow?

2017-11-01 10:06:21	wtheisen	Do I talk about research I did in highschool on my SOP if I did it at a university? Or is that taboo
2017-11-01 10:07:38	wtheisen	Also do I talk about my independent studies or just my research?
2017-11-01 10:14:57	wtheisen	also do I talk about my internship?
2017-11-01 10:19:03	dchiang	if it was real research, by all means talk about it
2017-11-01 10:19:25	dchiang	if your independent study and internship are relevant, then by all means talk about it
2017-11-01 10:20:32	dchiang	for example, if you were applying to nlp programs, and your internship involved debugging XML on the Alexa team, definitely talk about it
2017-11-01 10:21:13	dchiang	or if your internship involved something really creative but had little to do with nlp, still seems worth talking about
2017-11-01 10:38:12	dchiang	yesterday i called HR and told them my name and offered to spell it, but they said they already knew how to spell it. i thought that was nice. but today i called the sports ticket office and only said that my name was "david" and somehow they were able to locate my account number? that's really weird
2017-11-01 10:39:50	ncarroll	they must have new voice identification software?
2017-11-01 10:40:48	dchiang	https://github.com/dundalek/closh  @bdevorem @cshinave
2017-11-01 10:42:16	cshinave	Oh I like this.
2017-11-01 10:43:07	cshinave	Will push at work
2017-11-01 10:47:50	dchiang	don't know how this compares with scsh
2017-11-01 13:53:50	jeffrey	Is blaze pizza open now?
2017-11-01 14:04:59	catvajiac	jeffrey: i think so
2017-11-01 14:25:41	androidkitkat	i thought they got shut down
2017-11-01 14:31:42	jeffrey	I meant "have they reopened" and the answer is apparently yes
2017-11-01 14:31:45	jeffrey	as of Oct 27
2017-11-01 14:31:49	jeffrey	or something
2017-11-01 14:32:05	jeffrey	WAIT FAM I MESSED IT UP
2017-11-01 14:32:28	jeffrey	I forgot to say "Merry Christmas" to everyone yesterday.
2017-11-01 14:32:38	jeffrey	Because Oct31 = Dec25

2017-11-01 14:48:42	jeffrey	OCT31 = DEC25
2017-11-01 15:26:54	androidkitkat	ah yes
2017-11-01 15:28:45	androidkitkat	that clears it up
2017-11-01 15:46:11	androidkitkat	Can someone bring a USB-C to HDMI dongle to lug if anyone has it
2017-11-01 15:50:47	ncarroll	do you need it for a nintendo switch?
2017-11-01 15:51:35	androidkitkat	for my laptop lol
2017-11-01 16:10:19	wtheisen	If I'm going to grad school because I want to teach should I just lie on the SOP and say I want to be a researcher?

2017-11-01 17:57:13	androidkitkat	can we embed HTML

2017-11-01 18:05:55	androidkitkat	youre smarter than I
2017-11-01 18:20:04	jeffrey	I know how to. I've done it on my blog for my irc server. I just want to force people to work on the blog.
2017-11-01 18:21:53	androidkitkat	if i knew how, i would
2017-11-01 18:22:03	androidkitkat	but i tried getting hugo to work and it didnt work on windows
2017-11-01 18:26:03	jeffrey	Maybe we can get it to work on the student machines or appa.
2017-11-01 18:26:21	jeffrey	Also it works under the Windows subsystem for Linux
2017-11-01 18:27:08	androidkitkat	i dont think i have access to the student machines
2017-11-01 18:27:19	androidkitkat	and it says they have a windows version
2017-11-01 18:28:40	jeffrey	They do, but I haven't used it. I just know the subsystem works.
2017-11-01 18:39:35	jeffrey	Sweet @wbadart
2017-11-01 18:41:42	wbadart	yup
2017-11-01 18:42:30	wbadart	it's a little jank since you can't go anywhere else without confirming if you really want to leave the page, but I think the only workaround (at least for the kiwi client) would be to turn the blog into a single page app
2017-11-01 18:44:44	jeffrey	Do we want a dedicated page for the chat rather than have it on the homepage?
2017-11-01 18:45:11	wbadart	that'd be smart. how do you add a regular static page in hugo?
2017-11-01 18:47:15	jeffrey	Depends on whether you want it still formatted or not, but the static directory is for files that are just regular html
2017-11-01 18:47:47	jeffrey	By still formatted I meant run through the Markdown interpreter

2017-11-02 17:40:32	walter.scheirer	because of this
2017-11-02 18:04:39	jeffrey	tfw you are setting up a box and you run make, command not found, install it, make, gcc not found, install it, make, stdio.h no such file or directory...

2017-11-02 19:54:47	jeffrey	No
2017-11-02 19:55:00	jeffrey	If it were up to me no one would be banned
2017-11-02 19:55:44	jeffrey	Otherwise there is no reason to use the IRC chat over a private slack channel
2017-11-02 20:08:10	pbui	Yeah
2017-11-02 20:08:20	pbui	We shouldn't ban people

2017-11-02 22:08:13	pbui	no
2017-11-02 22:08:20	androidkitkat	what would that be
2017-11-02 22:08:28	pbui	androidkitkat: people take it after fund comp and discrete and possibly logic
2017-11-02 22:08:36	pbui	so it's their 2nd semester CS

2017-11-03 15:04:29	jeffrey	Fam, what do you think it would cost to put speakers everywhere in the United States such that no matter where you are you hear "What's New Pussycat" on repeat forever?
2017-11-03 15:05:13	pbui	probably not much, just hack everyone's phone or IOT device
2017-11-03 15:05:21	pbui	and just broadcast that way
2017-11-03 15:06:08	jeffrey	No but they could just smash the phone
2017-11-03 15:06:15	jeffrey	I need no escape
2017-11-03 15:06:34	jeffrey	I believe the labor could be orphan sourced
2017-11-03 15:06:48	jeffrey	So it's only a matter of material cost
2017-11-03 15:16:13	androidkitkat	That's a topic that should be in ethics
2017-11-03 15:16:36	walter.scheirer	the use of orphan labor?
2017-11-03 15:17:18	androidkitkat	Yes
2017-11-03 15:17:50	walter.scheirer	to quote @ssjohns: "I just want to help them by teaching them programming!!!"
2017-11-03 15:17:58	8bit	We're all passionate about orphan source here at #lug
2017-11-03 15:19:08	ssjohns	Are you talking about my orphans!!!!!
2017-11-03 15:19:53	jeffrey	I mean, honestly, in 13 years if @ssjohns ran for president on the orphan source platform, I'd vote for him
2017-11-03 15:21:06	androidkitkat	Did I miss the reddit thing
2017-11-03 15:21:31	androidkitkat	I bet I did
2017-11-03 15:22:14	ssjohns	Lol @androidkitkat it's Nov. 17th. I want it blasted to everyone on campus.
2017-11-03 15:22:38	walter.scheirer	i can't wait
2017-11-03 15:25:14	jeffrey	@ssjohns if you support my "put speakers everywhere" plan we could blast it to everyone
2017-11-03 15:25:41	8bit	tell me about your "put speakers everywhere" plan
2017-11-03 15:27:34	8bit	does consist of, say, putting speakers everywhere?
2017-11-03 15:28:26	ssjohns	We should start with. Notre Dame and blast the alma mater all day everyday.
2017-11-03 15:30:01	androidkitkat	Oh it's like a couple fridays
2017-11-03 15:30:10	androidkitkat	@pbui I'm headed over like soon
2017-11-03 15:32:21	pbui	akk
2017-11-03 15:33:20	androidkitkat	Yes?
2017-11-03 15:58:10	ssjohns	Lol, I love how I saw the first notification and immediately knew it was about orphans.
2017-11-03 15:58:14	ssjohns	I just knew!
2017-11-03 15:58:31	ssjohns	But can't wait to see y'all in a few weeks, make sure everyone comes to our talk!
2017-11-03 16:00:28	androidkitkat	le_ping
2017-11-03 16:37:33	flynn	pbui: you blurted “kotlin!” a few days ago — any opinions on it? Once of our alums thinks it would be great for teaching and there does seem to be some buzz for it, but primarily for android dev.
2017-11-03 16:43:54	a3qz	^ not pbui, but my response to that is that the buzz on kotlin is for the most part as a java replacement, but java is almost nonexistent in our program anyways
2017-11-03 16:55:04	pbui	yeah, that's my feeling as well, it's mostly pushed as a java replacement, but we don't do that anyways
2017-11-03 16:55:19	pbui	i think it could be interesting in paradigms or mobile
2017-11-03 16:55:25	pbui	but not as a core language
2017-11-03 16:55:48	ssjohns	http://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/technology/twitter-president-trump-account-how/index.html 
2017-11-03 16:56:03	ssjohns	@walter.scheirer Kinda security related.
2017-11-03 18:56:02	jeffrey	In ethics do we cover "I own X piece of digital content. Is it ethical to a. copy it directly from someone else, b. torrent it, and/or c. distribute it among friends?"
2017-11-03 19:23:26	pbui	Yes
2017-11-03 21:04:39	jeffrey	can I take the position that you can't own digital content
2017-11-03 21:12:18	pbui	people do

2017-11-04 11:14:38	pbui	already living the meme
2017-11-04 11:17:07	androidkitkat	Arch isn't a meme
2017-11-04 11:17:18	androidkitkat	Arch is a lifestyle
2017-11-04 11:17:43	pbui	alternative lifestyle
2017-11-04 11:18:41	androidkitkat	The best lifestyle
2017-11-04 11:22:50	androidkitkat	I do need help tho
2017-11-04 11:23:05	androidkitkat	Because the media keys are a lifestyle

2017-11-04 11:35:51	wtheisen	do you want the lines I use?
2017-11-04 11:36:17	androidkitkat	You had to add them?
2017-11-04 11:36:29	wtheisen	yeah, they're in my i3.config
2017-11-04 11:36:29	androidkitkat	I'm using arch through antegros
2017-11-04 11:36:39	androidkitkat	With gnome
2017-11-04 11:36:51	wtheisen	there's probably a gnome config
2017-11-04 11:36:55	wtheisen	you can add it to

2017-11-04 12:00:11	wtheisen	haha maybe I should have asked him for help when I tried to install arch

2017-11-04 12:06:45	androidkitkat	Is $350 too much?
2017-11-04 12:06:54	pbui	$350 is in the ballpark

2017-11-04 12:07:20	pbui	15in tho
2017-11-04 12:07:26	pbui	i think she wants something small
2017-11-04 12:07:28	androidkitkat	It's kabylake
2017-11-04 12:07:33	androidkitkat	Smaller?
2017-11-04 12:07:35	androidkitkat	Ok
2017-11-04 12:07:35	pbui	she is not a big person
2017-11-04 12:07:46	pbui	like 11-13in, < 3lbs
2017-11-04 12:07:51	pbui	ideally ssd
2017-11-04 12:08:00	pbui	but she can live
2017-11-04 12:09:31	androidkitkat	Gorcha
2017-11-04 12:10:13	androidkitkat	I'll find something

2017-11-04 12:17:17	androidkitkat	Not sure about this one
2017-11-04 12:17:23	androidkitkat	Looks bulky af
2017-11-04 12:17:37	androidkitkat	Actually don't buy that one
2017-11-04 12:17:43	androidkitkat	It's running not even Skylake

2017-11-04 12:22:53	androidkitkat	@pbui here's a 3340 refurbished on Amazon
2017-11-04 12:23:02	androidkitkat	Plenty of ram
2017-11-04 12:23:05	androidkitkat	Largeish ssd
2017-11-04 12:23:21	pbui	the educaton latitudes are bulky
2017-11-04 12:23:24	pbui	but that might be ok
2017-11-04 12:23:52	androidkitkat	Yeah it's a little bulk
2017-11-04 12:23:59	androidkitkat	I thought Lenovo might
2017-11-04 12:24:02	pbui	i ll send her these, thnx
2017-11-04 12:24:07	androidkitkat	Np
2017-11-04 12:24:09	pbui	i dont trust lenovo...
2017-11-04 12:24:12	androidkitkat	Dont
2017-11-04 12:24:14	pbui	superfish
2017-11-04 12:24:30	androidkitkat	I don't like thinkpads but they're sometimes really good deals
2017-11-04 12:25:12	wtheisen	get her an x61 so she can libreboot and be truly free
2017-11-04 12:27:35	androidkitkat	Get an IBM compatible PC
2017-11-04 12:27:42	pbui	wtheisen: thnx rms
2017-11-04 12:27:48	pbui	i think the have x200s now
2017-11-04 12:27:53	pbui	w/ libreboot
2017-11-04 12:30:01	wtheisen	I wish the xps was supported tbh
2017-11-04 12:31:31	androidkitkat	What's this?
2017-11-04 12:31:36	androidkitkat	Libreboot?
2017-11-04 12:31:42	androidkitkat	!g libreboot
2017-11-04 12:31:44	bobbit	@androidkitkat: https://yld.me/vLI 
2017-11-04 12:32:40	androidkitkat	Interesting
2017-11-04 13:06:48	androidkitkat	yo @wtheisen so i got most of my machine to work
2017-11-04 13:06:59	androidkitkat	just curious if you have two finger left click working
2017-11-04 13:07:09	androidkitkat	on the trackpad
2017-11-04 13:10:37	androidkitkat	because the way it is now has it three fingers = right click and two fingers does nothing afaik
2017-11-04 13:10:49	androidkitkat	two fingers is middle mouse button
2017-11-04 13:10:59	pbui	middle mouse is key
2017-11-04 13:11:20	androidkitkat	so all i have to do is go into some config file and swap them?
2017-11-04 13:11:31	pbui	i dunno
2017-11-04 13:11:38	pbui	my computer has real buttons
2017-11-04 13:11:40	pbui	:]
2017-11-04 13:11:52	androidkitkat	mine has regions but im determined
2017-11-04 13:12:05	androidkitkat	ill figure it out danggit
2017-11-04 13:15:36	pbui	you can try the synaptics driver
2017-11-04 13:16:04	pbui	oh wait
2017-11-04 13:16:09	pbui	check out this page: https://blog.spirotot.com/2016/07/27/dell-xps-15-9550-arch-linux-trackpad-gestures/ 
2017-11-04 13:16:15	pbui	seems to be what u want
2017-11-04 13:17:06	androidkitkat	its weird tho becasue the gnome trackpad setting detects all three types of clicks
2017-11-04 13:17:13	androidkitkat	one, two, and three finger
2017-11-04 13:17:22	pbui	that is weird
2017-11-04 13:17:23	androidkitkat	but the three finger and two finger clicks are backwards
2017-11-04 13:17:36	androidkitkat	where three fingers is right click and two is middle mouse
2017-11-04 13:17:48	pbui	i never use gnome, so i dont know how it interacts w/ the mouse
2017-11-04 13:18:05	androidkitkat	i think this synaptics thing might fix it
2017-11-04 13:18:11	androidkitkat	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Touchpad_Synaptics#Frequently_used_options 
2017-11-04 13:18:23	androidkitkat	maybe?
2017-11-04 13:19:27	androidkitkat	I DID PBUI
2017-11-04 13:20:19	pbui	so switching to synaptics works?
2017-11-04 13:20:24	pbui	that's what i use on my latitude
2017-11-04 13:20:30	pbui	even though it's deprecated
2017-11-04 13:20:33	pbui	sticks old things
2017-11-04 13:20:40	androidkitkat	well no i think i just had to swap button 2 =3 and button 3 =2
2017-11-04 13:20:48	androidkitkat	but let me kill xorg
2017-11-04 13:21:59	androidkitkat	im so proud of mysefl
2017-11-04 13:23:16	pbui	nice
2017-11-04 13:23:25	pbui	such a pro
2017-11-04 13:23:32	pbui	u a real archer now
2017-11-04 13:23:52	androidkitkat	btw i use arch
2017-11-04 13:25:37	androidkitkat	now only linux needs is programs that can run in the background like windows (slack, spotify, etc)
2017-11-04 13:26:49	pbui	what do u mean
2017-11-04 13:26:58	pbui	oh u mean u need to install slack?
2017-11-04 13:27:01	pbui	and spotify?
2017-11-04 13:27:09	pbui	i think both should work
2017-11-04 13:27:27	pbui	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Spotify 
2017-11-04 13:27:31	androidkitkat	no like where i can click the X and they still are in the taskbar thing
2017-11-04 13:27:53	androidkitkat	so i can "close them" but theyre still running
2017-11-04 13:28:08	pbui	install gnome-tweak-tool
2017-11-04 13:28:14	pbui	then u can add the minimize button
2017-11-04 13:28:20	pbui	gnome3 is dumb af
2017-11-04 13:28:24	androidkitkat	minimize is there
2017-11-04 13:29:05	androidkitkat	but like so theyre not "open" on my dock/taskbar but still are running up where like the clock is
2017-11-04 13:30:32	wtheisen	I think you shouldn't try and make linux too much like windows, the point is that linux isn't windows
2017-11-04 13:31:20	androidkitkat	i suppose
2017-11-04 13:31:28	androidkitkat	but the functionality was useful in windows
2017-11-04 13:31:42	pbui	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/spotify/ 
2017-11-04 13:31:46	pbui	known problem?
2017-11-04 13:31:54	pbui	"
2017-11-04 13:31:56	pbui	@cabbage: Maybe spotify removed the tray icon since it seems not to have any future anyway. Gnome 3.26 just removed the tray icon panel (see: https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.26/#thats-not-all  last section).
2017-11-04 13:32:09	androidkitkat	yeah the settings just arent there
2017-11-04 13:32:35	pbui	oh, so it is running
2017-11-04 13:32:37	pbui	but not in the dock?
2017-11-04 13:32:43	wtheisen	i3 allows that kind of functionalirty
2017-11-04 13:32:46	pbui	but there is still an icon in the tray?
2017-11-04 13:32:46	androidkitkat	its in the dock, but not the tray thing
2017-11-04 13:32:53	pbui	oh
2017-11-04 13:33:05	androidkitkat	yeah
2017-11-04 13:33:50	androidkitkat	its not a dealbreaker, just something that was nice in windows
2017-11-04 13:34:40	androidkitkat	also linux is the bomb.com  (or GNOME is) where the next track on spotify gives me anotification
2017-11-04 13:34:44	pbui	https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/495/topicons/ 
2017-11-04 13:34:48	pbui	install that extension?
2017-11-04 13:34:53	pbui	i think gnome removed tray icons
2017-11-04 13:34:56	pbui	b/c they hate users
2017-11-04 13:37:03	pbui	oh there is an even better one: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1031/topicons/ 
2017-11-04 13:38:34	androidkitkat	now to install it
2017-11-04 13:38:35	androidkitkat	somehow
2017-11-04 13:38:57	androidkitkat	because it just throws me a zip
2017-11-04 13:39:32	androidkitkat	theres a switch to flip
2017-11-04 13:39:39	wtheisen	probably unzip then make install
2017-11-04 13:41:50	pbui	which browser are you using androidkitkat
2017-11-04 13:41:57	androidkitkat	chromium
2017-11-04 13:42:07	androidkitkat	i installed the chrome extension and the arch thing
2017-11-04 13:42:15	pbui	oh
2017-11-04 13:42:17	pbui	ok
2017-11-04 13:42:34	androidkitkat	it works!
2017-11-04 13:42:44	pbui	oh snap
2017-11-04 13:42:46	androidkitkat	spotify doesnt get a tray icon but slack does so im happy
2017-11-04 13:42:52	pbui	how did u install it
2017-11-04 13:42:57	androidkitkat	flip the switch
2017-11-04 13:43:01	pbui	lol
2017-11-04 13:43:01	androidkitkat	on the extension page
2017-11-04 13:43:03	pbui	sweet
2017-11-04 13:43:08	pbui	maybe try to restart spotify
2017-11-04 13:43:11	pbui	see if that helps
2017-11-04 13:43:21	androidkitkat	i restarted gnome
2017-11-04 13:43:40	pbui	it sounds like it's storming outside
2017-11-04 13:43:44	androidkitkat	booo
2017-11-04 13:45:01	androidkitkat	linux is so cool i want to bring my laptop to the game
2017-11-04 13:45:08	androidkitkat	let everyone know i run arch
2017-11-04 13:45:15	pbui	that's a bit much
2017-11-04 13:45:25	androidkitkat	its still cool
2017-11-04 13:45:36	androidkitkat	and i want to config it perfectly
2017-11-04 13:45:48	pbui	u truly are a arch user now
2017-11-04 13:46:16	androidkitkat	thanks to you
2017-11-04 13:46:47	androidkitkat	:smile:
2017-11-04 13:47:46	pbui	derp
2017-11-04 13:47:51	pbui	let's be calm
2017-11-04 13:47:58	pbui	ur arch install will probalbly break in a week
2017-11-04 13:48:41	androidkitkat	not unless i use it like i do windows
2017-11-04 14:16:04	pbui	it is coming down
2017-11-04 14:16:38	wtheisen	true southbend weather here
2017-11-04 14:22:43	androidkitkat	:ok_hand:
2017-11-04 14:24:25	androidkitkat	honestly im taken back at how cool arch is
2017-11-04 14:24:32	androidkitkat	aback*
2017-11-04 14:25:08	catvajiac	:]
2017-11-04 14:29:18	androidkitkat	like this is way better than just slapping ubuntu onto it
2017-11-04 14:30:40	dougsmith	It gives you a lot of flexibility. Like most people wouldn't want to do any work on a lower level. What all have you played with?
2017-11-04 14:30:50	androidkitkat	ive just been configuring it
2017-11-04 14:31:01	androidkitkat	i like the AUR wayyyy more than apt-get
2017-11-04 14:34:23	pbui	i think the aur is arch's key feature
2017-11-04 14:34:37	pbui	like everything else, u can get somewhere else, for the most part
2017-11-04 14:34:47	pbui	like wtheisen built up his env on ubuntu
2017-11-04 14:34:51	pbui	w/ ubuntu-minimal
2017-11-04 14:34:57	pbui	u can do that w/ any distro
2017-11-04 14:35:07	pbui	but the AUR is something unique to arch
2017-11-04 14:35:25	pbui	b/c it's distributed/decentralized package curation
2017-11-04 14:35:35	pbui	so there are some downsides (quality control)
2017-11-04 14:35:45	pbui	but overall, it's pretty solid
2017-11-04 14:36:14	pbui	if u are into exploring and trying new things, i dont see how u dont use some sort of arch-based distro
2017-11-04 14:36:30	pbui	it's practically a meme that everything is in the AUR
2017-11-04 14:37:08	pbui	androidkitkat: shouldnt u be tailgating and getting ready for the game?
2017-11-04 14:45:33	androidkitkat	I don't tailgate :|
2017-11-04 14:45:42	androidkitkat	And I'm putting on my jeans jacket as intype
2017-11-04 14:45:58	androidkitkat	And folding my blanket
2017-11-04 14:48:57	androidkitkat	And I don't even know where to tailgate
2017-11-04 14:49:48	androidkitkat	Or how
2017-11-04 14:55:37	pbui	i didnt either

2017-11-05 12:46:37	pbui	funny enough we use that usb stick brand for lug
2017-11-05 12:46:43	pbui	for the linux live images
2017-11-05 12:47:23	pbui	oops, this was shared by silv3r
2017-11-05 12:48:17	silv3r	Wow....
2017-11-05 12:48:27	androidkitkat	at least the dude's co-worker gave him a clean windows install
2017-11-05 12:48:30	androidkitkat	stick
2017-11-05 12:48:31	silv3r	My existence is so insignificant
2017-11-05 12:48:46	androidkitkat	gj @pbui
2017-11-05 12:49:58	pbui	silv3r: i cant read, it's too early
2017-11-05 12:50:06	pbui	i needed to fall back a week
2017-11-05 12:50:08	pbui	not just 1 hour
2017-11-05 12:51:31	8bit	lol, I would so go for a week fall back
2017-11-05 12:54:58	dougsmith	Wait, so does that mean nothing due this week is actually due until next week? B/c if so I think my religion actually requires a one week fall back...
2017-11-05 12:57:24	8bit	The next week just wouldn't exist on the calendar.  It exists between November 5 and 6.  And nothing can be scheduled for that moment on the calendar.
2017-11-05 12:57:57	dougsmith	Oh... So I guess I'll go back to homework...
2017-11-05 12:58:10	8bit	no no it would function the same
2017-11-05 12:58:22	walter.scheirer	so i ended up getting an iphone 8
2017-11-05 12:58:51	walter.scheirer	the reviews for the X were too mediocre to justify buying it
2017-11-05 12:59:20	walter.scheirer	plus the six week wait...
2017-11-05 12:59:30	alitteke	:disappointed:
2017-11-05 12:59:52	walter.scheirer	and it's larger than the 8
2017-11-05 13:00:34	alitteke	I still need to see one side by side, I heard it’s bigger, but technically has more screen than the 8 Plus, but it’s weird just because it’s so much taller
2017-11-05 13:00:47	walter.scheirer	yeah
2017-11-05 13:00:52	walter.scheirer	i compared both at the apple store today
2017-11-05 13:01:19	alitteke	Although since you weren’t going to use FaceID I guess that kinda dissuades you from getting the X too
2017-11-05 13:01:27	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-11-05 13:01:45	walter.scheirer	under the hood, both phones are very similar
2017-11-05 13:01:47	walter.scheirer	same processors
2017-11-05 13:01:50	walter.scheirer	similar battery life
2017-11-05 13:01:50	androidkitkat	basically the same
2017-11-05 13:01:56	walter.scheirer	glass back for wireless charging
2017-11-05 13:02:18	androidkitkat	this is annoying
2017-11-05 13:02:30	androidkitkat	any other Chrome Linux users keep getting signed out after closing chrome
2017-11-05 13:02:32	alitteke	The battery is better on the X too I believe
2017-11-05 13:02:44	walter.scheirer	i think just slightly better
2017-11-05 13:02:55	androidkitkat	tried all three offical chrome channels and chromium
2017-11-05 13:02:56	walter.scheirer	since the battery on my 6 was basically shot
2017-11-05 13:03:02	walter.scheirer	this is a remarkable improvement
2017-11-05 13:03:04	walter.scheirer	regardless
2017-11-05 13:03:05	walter.scheirer	hehe
2017-11-05 13:03:47	alitteke	It’s supposed to be 2 hours more than the 8 on it’s own is what I think they said
2017-11-05 13:04:28	walter.scheirer	the X is noticeably heavier
2017-11-05 13:04:48	walter.scheirer	probably thanks to that extra battery capacity
2017-11-05 13:05:21	alitteke	There’s two batteries inside, so probably yes
2017-11-05 13:10:30	pbui	do u have more than 8GB of storage?
2017-11-05 13:10:34	pbui	b/c that would be fancy
2017-11-05 13:11:03	walter.scheirer	64
2017-11-05 13:11:48	alitteke	@pbui the base is 64
2017-11-05 13:12:29	pbui	oh...
2017-11-05 13:12:31	pbui	fancy
2017-11-05 13:16:47	androidkitkat	cept not microsd for up to 2 TB* of storage
2017-11-05 13:18:13	walter.scheirer	not sure i need that much capacity on a phone...
2017-11-05 13:18:43	jeffrey	Clearly you don't take video from both cameras and screen record at the same time 24/7
2017-11-05 13:19:00	walter.scheirer	clearly
2017-11-05 13:19:24	pbui	i have 32 GB on my phone
2017-11-05 13:19:30	pbui	for audio files and ebooks
2017-11-05 13:19:43	androidkitkat	32 GB base phone here too
2017-11-05 13:19:48	pbui	i try to avoid the cloud
2017-11-05 13:19:52	pbui	b/c privacy and stuff
2017-11-05 13:19:57	pbui	also b/c im cheap
2017-11-05 13:21:19	androidkitkat	its like super cheap for dropbox storage
2017-11-05 13:21:32	androidkitkat	or icloud idk
2017-11-05 13:21:42	pbui	i just back up files to my various usb silos
2017-11-05 13:21:53	pbui	i have a usb drive next to my workstation and at home
2017-11-05 13:21:59	pbui	and then i use git for most things
2017-11-05 13:22:01	pbui	so w/e
2017-11-05 13:22:14	walter.scheirer	local git?
2017-11-05 13:22:39	pbui	gitlab, bitbucket
2017-11-05 13:22:46	pbui	i only use github if i am contributing
2017-11-05 13:22:51	pbui	i also backup the git repos to usb
2017-11-05 13:22:53	pbui	when i remember
2017-11-05 13:22:55	walter.scheirer	those services are in the cloud sir...
2017-11-05 13:22:58	pbui	which is like never
2017-11-05 13:23:08	pbui	yeah, i avoid the cloud on my phone
2017-11-05 13:23:13	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-05 13:23:23	pbui	i like to keep my phone as dumb as possible
2017-11-05 13:23:37	pbui	i mean im using the cloud right now... via my VPS
2017-11-05 13:23:48	pbui	im not against the cloud, im against the data mining
2017-11-05 13:23:58	androidkitkat	start your own interwebz
2017-11-05 13:24:00	pbui	if people want to know how bad my python code, it's fine
2017-11-05 13:24:03	pbui	judge me
2017-11-05 13:37:17	pbui	https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15628869 
2017-11-05 13:37:26	pbui	"   Young people will correct any fantasies they have about genius, however, after they come to MIT. As they start doing research with their professors, as many MIT undergraduates do, they learn another healthy lesson, namely, a professor may well behave like a fumbling idiot."
2017-11-05 13:37:30	pbui	... got me
2017-11-05 13:37:55	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-05 13:38:40	walter.scheirer	that was written in 1997
2017-11-05 13:38:51	walter.scheirer	MIT kids waste more time now
2017-11-05 13:38:52	walter.scheirer	:stuck_out_tongue:
2017-11-05 13:38:56	pbui	b/c of the interwebs
2017-11-05 13:39:01	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-11-05 13:39:13	pbui	technology has ruined all of us
2017-11-05 13:46:31	pbui	"Most MIT students stop caring about grades freshman year. Most MIT students interact with one another in class as fellow masochists struggling together against a common foe (learning the material) rather than competing against one another for grades. This is what I would personally call the weirdest and most advantageous aspect of MIT versus Ivy Leagues, but I actually think state schools are
2017-11-05 13:46:33	pbui	awesome at this too."
2017-11-05 13:46:51	walter.scheirer	that's BS
2017-11-05 13:46:55	pbui	oh?
2017-11-05 13:47:02	walter.scheirer	there are plenty of p-set grade grubbers at MIT
2017-11-05 13:47:57	walter.scheirer	the academic environment there is extremely aggressive
2017-11-05 13:48:53	pbui	could be a generational change
2017-11-05 13:48:57	walter.scheirer	possibly
2017-11-05 13:49:04	pbui	b/c i think that is more true now at ND than when i was an undergrad
2017-11-05 13:49:10	walter.scheirer	but i know folks who were students there back in the 90s
2017-11-05 13:49:22	walter.scheirer	and they describe it as mostly the same as now
2017-11-05 13:49:46	pbui	so these are some rose-tinted glasses
2017-11-05 13:50:48	pbui	it's something we talked about at UWEC pretty often
2017-11-05 13:51:09	walter.scheirer	"This is what I would personally call the weirdest and most advantageous aspect of MIT versus Ivy Leagues"
2017-11-05 13:51:16	walter.scheirer	this sounds like the usual MIT vs. Harvard rivalry
2017-11-05 13:51:43	pbui	how current undergrads seemed very career focused
2017-11-05 13:51:48	walter.scheirer	the Harvard undergrads were far more relaxed than their MIT counterparts
2017-11-05 13:52:08	pbui	like internships were not as heavily emphasized when i was an undergrad as it is now
2017-11-05 13:52:16	walter.scheirer	hmm..
2017-11-05 13:52:16	pbui	i still have students missing classes and interviewing
2017-11-05 13:52:17	walter.scheirer	yeah
2017-11-05 13:52:18	pbui	it's terrible
2017-11-05 13:52:27	walter.scheirer	i'd say that is a universal change
2017-11-05 13:52:30	walter.scheirer	in the undergrad CS game
2017-11-05 13:52:39	pbui	yeah, i agree
2017-11-05 13:52:48	pbui	i did 0 internships
2017-11-05 13:52:55	pbui	and most of the people i knew didnt do anything either
2017-11-05 13:52:57	walter.scheirer	when i was in college, i don't recall many students doing internships during the summer
2017-11-05 13:53:11	walter.scheirer	like, i worked at a grocery store my freshman year
2017-11-05 13:53:26	pbui	i did some mortgage and loan stuff freshman year...
2017-11-05 13:53:35	walter.scheirer	but then i did get a job in a research lab
2017-11-05 13:53:38	walter.scheirer	and did that every summer
2017-11-05 13:53:40	pbui	like copying folders and faxing them
2017-11-05 13:53:43	walter.scheirer	for the rest of college
2017-11-05 13:53:47	pbui	lol, me too!
2017-11-05 13:54:06	walter.scheirer	but i'd say that was unusual
2017-11-05 13:55:18	pbui	it's unfortunate b/c if students play the game, then they run the risk of missing out
2017-11-05 13:55:32	pbui	but if they do, the miss out on school and other aspects of their lives
2017-11-05 13:55:40	pbui	i dunno if it can be fixed
2017-11-05 13:55:51	pbui	i just dont like what it has done to education
2017-11-05 13:55:54	walter.scheirer	missing the carefree summer days
2017-11-05 13:57:37	walter.scheirer	i've worked with high school interns that had better programming skills then professionals with 10+ years experience
2017-11-05 13:57:42	walter.scheirer	not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing...
2017-11-05 13:58:48	walter.scheirer	it's taking forever to setup my new phone...
2017-11-05 14:04:07	pbui	NSA MITM takes some time walter.scheirer
2017-11-05 14:06:09	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-05 14:06:30	androidkitkat	lol
2017-11-05 14:06:40	androidkitkat	is it just stuck activating your iphone?
2017-11-05 14:07:51	pbui	"activating" the wiretap
2017-11-05 14:23:37	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-05 14:23:44	walter.scheirer	nah, a bunch of my apps reset
2017-11-05 14:28:11	ewilli23	https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/11/03/education/edlife/american-graduate-student-stem.html 
2017-11-05 14:28:42	walter.scheirer	not a problem for our department
2017-11-05 14:28:43	walter.scheirer	as it turns out
2017-11-05 14:29:34	pbui	@ewilli23: i shared that during the game last night
2017-11-05 14:29:36	pbui	lol
2017-11-05 14:30:15	ewilli23	Oh...
2017-11-05 14:30:48	pbui	i think americans actually have an advantage in the grad app process
2017-11-05 14:30:52	pbui	b/c there are so few of them
2017-11-05 14:30:59	pbui	that was my understanding anyways
2017-11-05 14:46:24	wtheisen	I hope so :grimacing:
2017-11-05 14:48:36	pbui	:ok_hand:
2017-11-05 14:48:44	wtheisen	:ok_hand:
2017-11-05 14:49:53	walter.scheirer	also, recent trouble with visas is becoming more of a game changer
2017-11-05 14:50:06	walter.scheirer	some countries are effectively shutout
2017-11-05 14:50:11	walter.scheirer	e.g., Iran
2017-11-05 15:12:08	walter.scheirer	Yay, slack now functional on my new phone
2017-11-05 15:35:25	jeffrey	I just wanna go to a school near my wife and home, is that too much to ask
2017-11-05 15:35:55	walter.scheirer	good luck...
2017-11-05 15:42:08	pbui	two body problems are hard
2017-11-05 15:42:16	pbui	maybe if we could merge u into one unit

2017-11-05 15:57:41	walter.scheirer	du is your friend
2017-11-05 16:01:10	ewilli23	oh, that’s perfect
2017-11-05 16:01:12	ewilli23	thanks
2017-11-05 16:09:42	pbui	ewilli23: we did that in systems!?!?
2017-11-05 16:09:45	pbui	sigh
2017-11-05 16:10:03	ewilli23	That was a long time ago
2017-11-05 16:10:09	pbui	less than a year
2017-11-05 16:10:14	catvajiac	wow, called out
2017-11-05 16:10:16	catvajiac	savage
2017-11-05 16:10:56	ewilli23	More than 6 months
2017-11-05 16:15:02	pbui	i dont even
2017-11-05 16:15:20	catvajiac	pbui: u mean u cant even?
2017-11-05 16:15:28	pbui	turns in teaching badge, obviously cant even teach
2017-11-05 16:15:34	catvajiac	also, be calm
2017-11-05 16:15:39	pbui	entre calm?
2017-11-05 16:15:42	catvajiac	etre*
2017-11-05 16:15:45	catvajiac	so close
2017-11-05 16:15:47	pbui	w/e
2017-11-05 16:15:50	pbui	i dont russian
2017-11-05 16:15:50	catvajiac	see, im the bad teacher
2017-11-05 16:15:57	catvajiac	um, that's not even russian or romanian
2017-11-05 16:16:08	catvajiac	there's no edge between french and russian u cant just
2017-11-05 16:16:17	pbui	i can make graphs however i want
2017-11-05 16:16:27	catvajiac	ur the professor i guess
2017-11-05 16:16:36	pbui	also, i might stop doing graphs after next week
2017-11-05 16:16:41	catvajiac	:( :( :( :( :(
2017-11-05 16:16:42	pbui	two weeks of graphs is probably enough
2017-11-05 16:16:45	catvajiac	:( :( :( :( :(
2017-11-05 16:17:20	catvajiac	what would you replace it with?
2017-11-05 16:18:25	pbui	i guess we can still do it
2017-11-05 16:18:32	pbui	we can do hamiltonian path/knight's tour
2017-11-05 16:18:51	pbui	and i think we can do a min/max flow cut
2017-11-05 16:18:52	ewilli23	Hamilton???
2017-11-05 16:19:33	catvajiac	<3
2017-11-05 16:19:44	catvajiac	dont skip the cool stuff/the stuff i dont know yet
2017-11-05 16:19:53	pbui	oh... i need to work in a hamilton reference dont it
2017-11-05 16:20:02	catvajiac	yeah, that would be a good idea
2017-11-05 16:20:05	pbui	hamilton needs to visit all 13 colonies
2017-11-05 16:20:13	pbui	but he can only visit each one once
2017-11-05 16:20:16	pbui	or something
2017-11-05 16:28:46	8bit	lol
2017-11-05 17:00:32	androidkitkat	ive never seen or heard anything about hamilton so i dont get the joke
2017-11-05 17:02:28	ewilli23	It doesn’t really have anything to do with hamilton
2017-11-05 17:02:54	ewilli23	A Hamiltonian path is a path through a graph that touches each node exactly once
2017-11-05 17:03:28	mflanag6	I thought a Hamiltonian was a type of sandwich
2017-11-05 17:04:48	pbui	that's the reuben
2017-11-05 17:05:23	mflanag6	the reubiltonian
2017-11-05 17:11:52	jbaker10	I can determine if a graph has a Hamiltonian path is cubic time. Nbd
2017-11-05 18:16:45	androidkitkat	is there a way to print using a system dialog on Linux for printND
2017-11-05 18:29:43	wtheisen	what do you mean? I just use the web portal to print from linux, will that not work?
2017-11-05 18:31:11	androidkitkat	it does but being able to just control+p was nice
2017-11-05 19:31:05	androidkitkat	o man i am so good i solved my media keys forever

2017-11-05 22:46:52	tweninger	Just a heads up for you scholarship/fellowship recipients: New tax plan will treat scholarships a income and tax them as income.
2017-11-05 22:46:52	tweninger	This includes graduate students, who would be taxed on their tuition waiver.
2017-11-05 22:50:54	8bit	_oh no_
2017-11-05 22:51:12	catvajiac	that is actually really upsetting
2017-11-05 22:51:14	8bit	This is pretty worrying
2017-11-05 22:53:01	tweninger	Speaking as a neutral party: may I suggest you call your DC representatives and tell them how you feel.

2017-11-05 23:23:38	pbui	like, wut
2017-11-05 23:29:56	pbui	this goes well w/ the americans dont go to grad school article

2017-11-06 09:10:11	wtheisen	man it’s so weird that it doesn’t say “shared from reddit” or something. @ssjohns is gonna come after me
2017-11-06 09:47:38	androidkitkat	"Unix-like operating systems such as Linux do not have an undelete command.
2017-11-06 09:47:38	androidkitkat	Once you delete something with rm, it's gone. Linux assumes you're smart and

2017-11-06 11:38:48	alitteke	It actually has more disagreement
2017-11-06 11:40:26	androidkitkat	more to think about!
2017-11-06 12:38:24	walter.scheirer	i'm exchanging some emails with some potential special guests who may be joining me when i visit ND SV next semester for the security class
2017-11-06 12:38:43	walter.scheirer	this will be amazing if i can work out the details
2017-11-06 12:52:55	jeffrey	Fam, how are argv and argc set on Linux? I know they are put on the stack in _start, but how?
2017-11-06 12:53:38	jeffrey	Does the OS do something like "make process stack argc bigger", and just strcpy a bunch?
2017-11-06 12:58:56	flynn	Off to the ABI manual for you: https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/402129/mpx-linux64-abi.pdf  .
2017-11-06 12:59:01	flynn	Start at p.33
2017-11-06 13:01:00	jeffrey	Sweet, thanks.
2017-11-06 13:01:26	walter.scheirer	i really hope the kernel is not using strcpy() *anywhere*
2017-11-06 13:02:28	wtheisen	strncpy is so much better
2017-11-06 13:03:15	walter.scheirer	strlcpy people!
2017-11-06 13:04:07	flynn	Upon further thought, I'm not sure the ABI manual helps much with this question. #wildgoosechase
2017-11-06 13:04:14	flynn	scratches head
2017-11-06 13:04:39	wtheisen	people keep asking me about security @walter.scheirer I️ say as long as it isn’t at 5:05 again take it :yum:
2017-11-06 13:04:46	walter.scheirer	it isn't
2017-11-06 13:04:49	walter.scheirer	we are never doing that time again
2017-11-06 13:04:53	jeffrey	It mentioned that the strings are stored at high addresses, which is at least something.
2017-11-06 13:06:22	jeffrey	I suppose I could just store them above the stack, then set up pointers to the locations in the stack, th en pass the pointer to the first argument as argv.
2017-11-06 13:08:49	flynn	Makes sense for the newly created process's stack to contain argv and env strings, then envps and argvps, then argc. This page suggests that is how it is done: http://www.mindfruit.co.uk/2012/01/initial-stack-reading-process-arguments.html  . So the location of the argvps is close to the locations of the strings themselves.

2017-11-06 13:23:19	jeffrey	I think I at least have a clear idea of something that might work. I think my only issue now is "When I launch a process I'll be using the calling process' pagetable, but I'll need to be messing with my new process' stack."
2017-11-06 13:23:56	jeffrey	Which i think I'll be able to figure out. Thanks.

2017-11-06 14:50:27	catvajiac	jbaker10: idk some random peeps
2017-11-06 14:57:55	jeffrey	tfw you are like "I'm trying to set argc from the kernel directly in the stack, but it is always 0 for some reason" and then you see that _start is `main(0,0)`, and is invoked later.
2017-11-06 16:46:35	jeffrey	That wasn't my only issue. Something seems to be zeroing the memory above the stack in between loading the process into memory and main being executed.

2017-11-06 17:08:40	pbui	"Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3437U CPU @ 1.90GHz"
2017-11-06 17:08:57	androidkitkat	Skylake is cheap enough and still a big update
2017-11-06 17:09:22	jeffrey	Get a ryzen desktop
2017-11-06 17:09:42	jeffrey	Wait for pricing on raven ridge laptops

2017-11-06 17:15:54	pbui	im gonna wait to see what the amd laptops are like
2017-11-06 17:16:02	pbui	i kinda want to go away from intel
2017-11-06 17:16:09	pbui	engages in hipster mode
2017-11-06 17:16:15	pbui	but only if the hw support is there
2017-11-06 17:17:34	androidkitkat	It should be
2017-11-06 17:17:47	jeffrey	It wasn't for linux at launch
2017-11-06 17:17:54	pbui	like w/ intel, the cpu, gpu, and wireless all just work (tm)
2017-11-06 17:18:03	pbui	i think the cpu/gpu should be ok
2017-11-06 17:18:07	pbui	im not sure about wireless
2017-11-06 17:18:11	jeffrey	Also, hipster would be jumping to ARM
2017-11-06 17:18:17	pbui	if it gets paired w/ broadcom, i would pass
2017-11-06 17:18:21	pbui	not dealing w/ that
2017-11-06 17:18:26	jeffrey	just swap it out
2017-11-06 17:18:49	pbui	i would consider an ARM laptop
2017-11-06 17:18:59	pbui	but most of the ones ive seen are really gimmicky
2017-11-06 17:19:05	jeffrey	you could run ALARM
2017-11-06 17:19:17	pbui	y
2017-11-06 17:19:22	pbui	void has an arm port
2017-11-06 17:19:24	jeffrey	I ran alarm on my tablet
2017-11-06 17:19:29	pbui	it's what i use for my RPIs
2017-11-06 17:19:29	jeffrey	well, alarm is a dope name
2017-11-06 17:19:35	pbui	VOID
2017-11-06 17:19:43	jeffrey	ARCH
2017-11-06 17:19:56	catvajiac	pbui: what distro do u run? im sorry, im not sure i can make it out
2017-11-06 17:20:10	pbui	did u know androidkitkat runs arch?
2017-11-06 17:20:15	jeffrey	yes
2017-11-06 17:20:17	pbui	he can report about his experience at this week's meeting
2017-11-06 17:20:22	catvajiac	pbui: did u know jeffrey runs arch
2017-11-06 17:20:30	pbui	that is if it lasts until then
2017-11-06 17:20:32	jeffrey	btw I run arch
2017-11-06 17:20:41	catvajiac	jeffrey: dood rly?
2017-11-06 17:20:46	catvajiac	i had no clue
2017-11-06 17:20:47	androidkitkat	Oh yeah I run arch too
2017-11-06 17:20:55	catvajiac	you know who else runs arch?
2017-11-06 17:20:57	catvajiac	not pbui
2017-11-06 17:21:04	ccarball	I run antergos
2017-11-06 17:21:05	androidkitkat	Why is there not an arch icon
2017-11-06 17:21:08	jeffrey	I wanna run arch hurd
2017-11-06 17:21:13	jeffrey	what do you mean no icon
2017-11-06 17:21:17	androidkitkat	Antegros is arch
2017-11-06 17:21:20	androidkitkat	Like emoji here
2017-11-06 17:21:24	jeffrey	oh
2017-11-06 17:21:30	jeffrey	does any distro have an emoji here?
2017-11-06 17:21:35	catvajiac	i dont think so
2017-11-06 17:21:36	androidkitkat	I can't let people know I don't run arch
2017-11-06 17:21:46	catvajiac	androidkitkat: ?
2017-11-06 17:22:08	androidkitkat	That should be worded better
2017-11-06 17:24:17	androidkitkat	okay thats annoyin
2017-11-06 17:24:44	pbui	https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/ryzen-mobile-faq 
2017-11-06 17:24:56	androidkitkat	@pbui its rad
2017-11-06 17:25:13	androidkitkat	also is there a way to fix my computer from like shutting down when i close itg
2017-11-06 17:25:16	androidkitkat	because thats annoying
2017-11-06 17:27:02	jeffrey	what os? and what computer? I assume a laptop?
2017-11-06 17:27:14	jeffrey	arch on laptop?
2017-11-06 17:27:15	androidkitkat	Arch/Antegros Xps 13 9350
2017-11-06 17:27:16	androidkitkat	yea
2017-11-06 17:27:34	pbui	androidkitkat: yes, it's a systemd setting
2017-11-06 17:28:00	androidkitkat	how fix
2017-11-06 17:28:01	androidkitkat	wait
2017-11-06 17:28:04	androidkitkat	ill look it up
2017-11-06 17:28:06	androidkitkat	and read the manual
2017-11-06 17:28:36	androidkitkat	the only real question i have is like there a way to "expand a disk" and give / and /home more space
2017-11-06 17:28:56	jeffrey	yes, provided you actually have more space
2017-11-06 17:29:00	androidkitkat	i do
2017-11-06 17:29:03	jeffrey	ok
2017-11-06 17:29:06	androidkitkat	i took another 50 gb from windows
2017-11-06 17:29:20	pbui	!give androidkitkat !g man logind.conf
2017-11-06 17:29:22	bobbit	@androidkitkat: https://yld.me/gNE 
2017-11-06 17:29:31	androidkitkat	thats a cool command
2017-11-06 17:29:42	androidkitkat	oh bobbit doesnt have the manual
2017-11-06 17:31:07	jeffrey	(btw, when I installed arch on my tablet, I wanted to resize the partition... I didn't realize when it asked for the new start of the partition that it was an absolute number and not a relative number, so I entered 0 thinking that meant "no change", but it meant "start the partition at the start of the disk", and it overwrote the boot partition, rendering the tablet a brick, as it included some nonsense about code signing that I needed and now lost forever)
2017-11-06 17:31:37	jeffrey	Fortunately it's harder to do that to a computer
2017-11-06 17:32:04	androidkitkat	thankfully
2017-11-06 17:32:29	pbui	it also depends on ryzen's power consumption
2017-11-06 17:32:39	pbui	id like six hours of battery life
2017-11-06 17:32:41	jeffrey	It's stated at ~15W nominal
2017-11-06 17:32:44	pbui	right now i have about 4
2017-11-06 17:33:19	jeffrey	I get about 7-8 depending on screen brightness, and I have a 15W i7-5500U
2017-11-06 17:33:55	pbui	linux will also need to be able to scale the cpu too
2017-11-06 17:33:58	pbui	to manage the power
2017-11-06 17:35:31	jeffrey	Also that 66fps overwatch stat looks dope, even at 79% render scale and low settings
2017-11-06 17:35:51	pbui	https://newsroom.intel.com/editorials/new-intel-core-processor-combine-high-performance-cpu-discrete-graphics-sleek-thin-devices/ 
2017-11-06 17:35:53	pbui	wut
2017-11-06 17:35:54	androidkitkat	y u no work novo
2017-11-06 17:35:58	pbui	intel cpu + amd gpu
2017-11-06 17:36:00	pbui	lol
2017-11-06 17:36:21	androidkitkat	i guess i need to try windows for this ;|
2017-11-06 17:36:25	jeffrey	That was a rumor last year, I believed it, then hacker news was like "lol, obviously false"
2017-11-06 17:36:41	jeffrey	and today some comments were like "this is bad for everyone"
2017-11-06 17:39:34	androidkitkat	how do i find when my finals are
2017-11-06 17:40:25	jeffrey	https://inside.nd.edu/launch-task/all/finalexamsummary?terms=finals 
2017-11-06 17:40:43	jeffrey	"My final exam summary" on insidend
2017-11-06 17:41:00	androidkitkat	advisor said novo
2017-11-06 17:42:06	jeffrey	idk if it is on novo
2017-11-06 17:42:26	androidkitkat	well this works
2017-11-06 17:42:36	androidkitkat	even tho it lists classes that dont have finals
2017-11-06 17:42:51	pbui	u can just go to the registrar's page
2017-11-06 17:43:07	jeffrey	but then you gotta look them all up by hand, don't you? @pbui
2017-11-06 17:43:21	pbui	control-f
2017-11-06 17:43:33	jeffrey	but, click link and get list of just your exams
2017-11-06 17:43:42	pbui	nah
2017-11-06 17:43:45	pbui	u have to 2FA
2017-11-06 17:43:47	pbui	to login
2017-11-06 17:43:49	pbui	:]
2017-11-06 17:43:55	jeffrey	I was already logged in
2017-11-06 17:44:14	pbui	i use all incognito windows
2017-11-06 17:44:18	pbui	j/k
2017-11-06 17:44:23	pbui	batrick does that actually
2017-11-06 17:44:26	pbui	i think
2017-11-06 17:44:28	jeffrey	also, I am _really_ considering setting up Tasker to just auto-accept any 2FA for ND
2017-11-06 17:45:41	androidkitkat	i should learn tasker
2017-11-06 17:46:35	androidkitkat	B)
2017-11-06 17:46:38	androidkitkat	:arch:
2017-11-06 17:47:27	jeffrey	:arch:
2017-11-06 17:47:54	androidkitkat	btw i use :arch"
2017-11-06 17:47:57	androidkitkat	fail
2017-11-06 17:52:33	jeffrey	I.. can't copy to the first ~4000 bytes of the stack
2017-11-06 17:53:06	androidkitkat	-f
2017-11-06 17:55:09	jeffrey	... I bet I know why, maybe
2017-11-06 17:56:03	jeffrey	I bet it wants to put the stdio buffer there
2017-11-06 18:00:55	androidkitkat	so @jeffrey i assume i can expand the partition using gparted
2017-11-06 18:01:11	jeffrey	I don't see why not
2017-11-06 18:01:18	androidkitkat	do i have to unmount
2017-11-06 18:01:21	androidkitkat	the disk
2017-11-06 18:01:40	androidkitkat	or wait
2017-11-06 18:01:47	androidkitkat	do i have to format the free space as ext4 first
2017-11-06 18:01:59	jeffrey	I don't think so
2017-11-06 18:02:28	androidkitkat	its odd because when i go to resize/move /home it wont let me get any bigger
2017-11-06 18:02:32	androidkitkat	and it has a key icon next to it
2017-11-06 18:03:12	jeffrey	do you have a live drive you can do this off of?
2017-11-06 18:03:19	androidkitkat	i might with me
2017-11-06 18:04:12	androidkitkat	i dont
2017-11-06 18:09:59	jeffrey	Need/want to borrow one?
2017-11-06 18:10:16	jeffrey	Also, why are memory addresses 0xFFFFF000 and up unwriteable?!? WHY?
2017-11-06 18:10:21	jeffrey	Who told them to be all 0.
2017-11-06 18:13:38	androidkitkat	i have one
2017-11-06 18:13:43	androidkitkat	its just in my desk
2017-11-06 18:13:51	androidkitkat	im learning how to register
2017-11-06 18:13:58	jeffrey	For class?
2017-11-06 18:14:03	androidkitkat	yea
2017-11-06 18:29:41	androidkitkat	Okay I need to solve this issue
2017-11-06 18:41:14	pbui	@tweninger gonna play this in tomorrow's ethics class: https://youtu.be/IVsz5xFd3qU 
2017-11-06 18:42:08	jeffrey	Any ideas why the top 0xFF0 bytes of memory might be always 0?
2017-11-06 18:54:21	tweninger	Oh geez - I was practically a great student when I have that talk
2017-11-06 18:54:25	tweninger	Grad**
2017-11-06 19:19:50	pbui	*great*
2017-11-06 19:19:51	pbui	:]
2017-11-06 19:20:30	androidkitkat	what was the command to restart gnome @pbui
2017-11-06 19:20:37	androidkitkat	pkill gnome makes it sad
2017-11-06 19:20:47	pbui	pkill Xorg
2017-11-06 19:20:57	pbui	there is probably a more graceful way to do it
2017-11-06 19:21:05	androidkitkat	if it works tho
2017-11-06 19:22:17	androidkitkat	now to close the laptop
2017-11-06 19:22:31	androidkitkat	fingers crossed
2017-11-06 19:24:53	androidkitkat	omg
2017-11-06 19:24:53	androidkitkat	omg
2017-11-06 19:24:53	bobbit	@androidkitkat: Leave me alone

2017-11-06 19:37:42	androidkitkat	i dont think there is a way to extend my root or home partitions
2017-11-06 19:40:00	jeffrey	even when booted into a live thumbdrive?
2017-11-06 19:41:15	androidkitkat	when i booted and went to expand /home it was only max 33 GB
2017-11-06 19:43:53	androidkitkat	I can expand root it seems
2017-11-06 19:44:15	androidkitkat	But why not /home
2017-11-06 19:45:19	androidkitkat	I know why
2017-11-06 19:45:20	androidkitkat	I think
2017-11-06 19:45:26	androidkitkat	The way the space is
2017-11-06 19:47:54	androidkitkat	ill worry about it when i need to
2017-11-06 20:18:26	ssjohns	@dchiang Hey are you going to NIPS this year?

2017-11-06 20:51:11	androidkitkat	any game where we win x-0 would be nice
2017-11-06 20:52:19	jeffrey	3-0 would not be nice
2017-11-06 20:52:27	jeffrey	Then we mightn't make the playoffs
2017-11-06 20:52:34	androidkitkat	x > 14
2017-11-06 20:52:38	jeffrey	x=37
2017-11-06 20:52:47	androidkitkat	solve for x
2017-11-06 20:53:00	jeffrey	My freshman year we beat Michigan 37-0
2017-11-06 20:53:09	catvajiac	i remember that fondly
2017-11-06 20:53:14	catvajiac	i was in the second row :]
2017-11-06 20:54:14	jeffrey	I was laughing so hard when they took away our last touchdown.
2017-11-06 20:54:49	jeffrey	Because I texted my family saying "Notre Dame won 37-0, hopefully there are no last minute penalties to change that."
2017-11-06 20:55:38	jeffrey	(The year before, in robotics, that happened literally every match "oh, we won 51-15" and then minutes later "oh, we lost 51-165", because penalties.)
2017-11-06 20:56:08	catvajiac	lol i still count it tho
2017-11-06 20:56:13	jeffrey	Everyone does.
2017-11-06 20:56:35	walter.scheirer	you controlled a robot football league?
2017-11-06 20:56:49	jeffrey	FIRST robotics
2017-11-06 20:56:53	jeffrey	not football
2017-11-06 20:57:16	jeffrey	I tried to join the robot football team here, but @ssjohns was on it so I stopped going.
2017-11-06 21:50:43	dchiang	@ssjohns no, actually i've never been
2017-11-06 22:29:37	jeffrey	I figured out my problem fam - the pagetable code ANDed virtual addresses with 0xFFFFF0, so it was rounding the stack page down.
2017-11-06 23:19:31	jeffrey	note to self: do not pass in a physical address in argv
2017-11-06 23:59:24	jcioffi	can college of science students do CDT?
2017-11-07 00:00:48	jcioffi	or is it just arts and letters?
2017-11-07 07:03:37	pbui	Arts and letters
2017-11-07 09:23:52	tweninger	http://www.chronicle.com/article/There-Is-No-Such-Thing-as/241633 ?
2017-11-07 09:24:00	tweninger	@walter.scheirer ^^
2017-11-07 09:24:18	walter.scheirer	i'm pretty sure there is such a thing as the digital humanities
2017-11-07 09:24:21	walter.scheirer	i've been to the conference
2017-11-07 09:24:28	walter.scheirer	it's real
2017-11-07 09:25:06	walter.scheirer	"Angela Davis published Are Prisons Obsolete? in 2003, yet prisons persist."
2017-11-07 09:25:21	walter.scheirer	clearly Eric Weiskott didn't read that book
2017-11-07 09:26:46	walter.scheirer	because it didn't hold the expectation that the prison system would be abolished by 2017
2017-11-07 09:26:53	walter.scheirer	i am unfollowing him on twitter
2017-11-07 09:26:54	walter.scheirer	:stuck_out_tongue:
2017-11-07 09:27:09	tweninger	and just like that the filter bubble thickens
2017-11-07 09:27:12	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 09:27:17	pbui	We have a meeting today?
2017-11-07 09:27:28	walter.scheirer	yeah
2017-11-07 09:27:30	walter.scheirer	which, isn't ideal
2017-11-07 09:27:36	walter.scheirer	because it collides with the seminar
2017-11-07 09:27:38	tweninger	I think David and Chris are wrestling over that
2017-11-07 09:27:46	pbui	I was not ready for that's
2017-11-07 09:28:03	tweninger	It was also not on my schedule
2017-11-07 09:28:19	walter.scheirer	it was on mine
2017-11-07 09:28:23	walter.scheirer	fwiw
2017-11-07 09:28:58	wtheisen	pbui are you going to add those fake news channels to #news now?
2017-11-07 09:29:51	pbui	Does infowars have a RSS feed related to cs or ND?
2017-11-07 09:30:43	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-07 09:31:04	walter.scheirer	i can only imagine the conspiracy theories associated with ND...
2017-11-07 09:33:12	tweninger	http://lmgtfy.com/?q=site%3Ainfowars.com+%22university+of+notre+dame%22 
2017-11-07 09:34:12	wtheisen	R E K T
2017-11-07 09:34:59	walter.scheirer	Alan Keyes got arrested here?
2017-11-07 09:35:20	walter.scheirer	apparently not fake news
2017-11-07 09:35:21	walter.scheirer	ha
2017-11-07 09:35:42	walter.scheirer	arrested twice here

2017-11-07 10:11:37	walter.scheirer	https://paritytech.io/blog/security-alert.html 
2017-11-07 10:11:45	walter.scheirer	190MM in equivalent Ethereum destroyed by a bug/vulnerability in the Parity multi-sig wallet implementation
2017-11-07 10:12:25	walter.scheirer	cryptocurrencies are a safe and stable replacement for fiat currencies
2017-11-07 10:12:27	walter.scheirer	coughs
2017-11-07 10:42:55	walter.scheirer	https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/7/16612288/gop-tax-bill-graduate-students 
2017-11-07 10:43:02	walter.scheirer	more on the grad student tax
2017-11-07 10:44:22	walter.scheirer	my gut feeling is that tax reform won't pass at all
2017-11-07 10:44:29	walter.scheirer	so i won't worry about this for now...
2017-11-07 10:44:32	walter.scheirer	la la la
2017-11-07 10:44:38	walter.scheirer	looks the other way
2017-11-07 10:47:11	dchiang	the "dramatic example" is actually completely typical for cs students, including ours
2017-11-07 11:01:21	bdevorem	@pbui emery told me that jeffrey and i should write a paper about our esoteric compiler suite from hackers last year
2017-11-07 11:14:37	androidkitkat	@androidkitkat uploaded a file: IMG_20171107_111330.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U6R5KVD4L/F7X6M2PP0/img_20171107_111330.jpg  and commented: Hey input guys. Will this break anything? Trying to give my root and home partitions more space
2017-11-07 11:14:53	walter.scheirer	hope you have a backup...
2017-11-07 11:15:03	androidkitkat	Can you see the photo?
2017-11-07 11:15:22	androidkitkat	And I keep everything on Windows in OneDrive if it's worth saving
2017-11-07 11:19:40	androidkitkat	And it borked windows
2017-11-07 11:19:42	androidkitkat	Fun
2017-11-07 11:20:03	walter.scheirer	surprise surprise...
2017-11-07 11:20:07	androidkitkat	Arch however works flawlessly
2017-11-07 11:20:24	androidkitkat	Let me.try safe mode windows
2017-11-07 11:20:27	8bit	well I guess now you have to use arch for everything
2017-11-07 11:20:50	androidkitkat	And now wifi isn't working what
2017-11-07 11:20:56	androidkitkat	On arch
2017-11-07 11:21:35	8bit	uh oh

2017-11-07 11:22:17	androidkitkat	can i touch my windows files from linux lets see
2017-11-07 11:22:33	androidkitkat	oh wait
2017-11-07 11:22:39	androidkitkat	i have a windows 10 install key
2017-11-07 11:22:44	androidkitkat	maybe it can work magic
2017-11-07 11:22:51	androidkitkat	and fix it
2017-11-07 11:24:04	androidkitkat	this was a dumb idea to do
2017-11-07 11:24:53	walter.scheirer	we learn from our mistakes...
2017-11-07 11:25:54	androidkitkat	we do
2017-11-07 11:26:06	androidkitkat	but it just surprises me that windows can expand and shrink all it wants to
2017-11-07 11:26:09	androidkitkat	but linux cant
2017-11-07 11:26:21	androidkitkat	Windows-1, Linux-0
2017-11-07 11:26:30	wtheisen	you can mount ur windows partition in linux
2017-11-07 11:27:40	androidkitkat	yeah but i might have to reinstall arch

2017-11-07 12:25:39	pbui	it might be more a partition thing
2017-11-07 12:25:42	pbui	than a filesystemt hing
2017-11-07 12:25:45	pbui	thing*
2017-11-07 12:40:54	androidkitkat	@pbui yeah but i killed it

2017-11-07 12:58:20	androidkitkat	do you want to overheat
2017-11-07 12:58:56	androidkitkat	Because choosing NoVideo is how you get high temps

2017-11-07 16:58:39	androidkitkat	are there group messages
2017-11-07 16:58:55	ssjohns	Not yet. We're still dealing with stuff around that.
2017-11-07 16:59:08	ssjohns	Mainly making sure people don't abuse it to attack others.
2017-11-07 16:59:12	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 16:59:22	androidkitkat	oh i forsee that being an issue

2017-11-07 17:00:23	ssjohns	That's literally an irc client.
2017-11-07 17:00:26	jeffrey	Hey, so, I know a group of people who might have work related to making sure people aren't abusive in chats @ssjohns *hint hint, nudge nudge*
2017-11-07 17:00:26	bobbit	@ssjohns: https://yld.me/rPA

2017-11-07 17:03:20	jeffrey	Can we set up the Shaq Anti-Defamation League? We can call it "SADL".
2017-11-07 17:04:38	pbui	SADL!
2017-11-07 17:08:36	jeffrey	"FAKE NEWS professor tries to spread lies about me doxxing. The Ethics class has become a joke. Sadl!"
2017-11-07 17:10:27	pbui	none of those things are false

2017-11-07 19:52:00	walter.scheirer	“Students at selective colleges are allowed to explore their intellectual curiosity as undergraduates because they will get their job training in graduate school or have access to a network that gets them top jobs, regardless of their undergraduate major,” Dr. Carnevale said.
2017-11-07 19:52:02	walter.scheirer	truth
2017-11-07 19:52:51	walter.scheirer	"A handful of colleges, including Indiana University and the Evergreen State College, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at Indiana — enigmatology."
2017-11-07 19:52:54	walter.scheirer	this seems... risk
2017-11-07 20:01:52	jeffrey	Can I have my own major?
2017-11-07 20:02:33	walter.scheirer	sure, just transfer over to IU
2017-11-07 20:03:04	walter.scheirer	Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.
2017-11-07 20:03:08	walter.scheirer	there you go
2017-11-07 20:04:36	androidkitkat	My major is Arch Linux
2017-11-07 20:05:14	catvajiac	androidkitkat: wait....do you.....run.......
2017-11-07 20:05:19	catvajiac	ubuntu
2017-11-07 20:05:24	androidkitkat	No i use arch btw
2017-11-07 20:05:28	silv3r	Mac OS?
2017-11-07 20:05:32	silv3r	Ohhh
2017-11-07 20:05:34	catvajiac	MS-DOS?
2017-11-07 20:05:41	catvajiac	oh no wait i got it
2017-11-07 20:05:43	catvajiac	PONYOS
2017-11-07 20:05:46	8bit	On irc I don't see any images so maybe he uses ubuntu
2017-11-07 20:05:46	silv3r	You mean Windows XP
2017-11-07 20:05:53	androidkitkat	i used to use DOS
2017-11-07 20:06:04	catvajiac	it's definitely ponyops

2017-11-07 20:07:06	androidkitkat	I'm so used to ShareX on Windows
2017-11-07 20:07:12	jeffrey	I am considering installing Windows XP, to develop for the greatest of all entertainment systems, the Nintendo 64
2017-11-07 20:07:20	androidkitkat	Just use a VM
2017-11-07 20:07:22	8bit	I wonder who's the weebiest in lug

2017-11-07 20:07:44	jeffrey	Noah called my roommate and I weebs
2017-11-07 20:07:54	silv3r	It’s cuz I’m a Weeb
2017-11-07 20:07:55	androidkitkat	still somewhat relies on GUI's even tho he wont find one for his needs on *nix
2017-11-07 20:07:58	silv3r	I can do it
2017-11-07 20:08:03	jeffrey	Just for RPing as DRRR characters.

2017-11-07 20:13:21	walter.scheirer	uh huh
2017-11-07 20:13:28	walter.scheirer	backs away slowly
2017-11-07 20:13:50	wtheisen	@abrizius
2017-11-07 20:13:58	wtheisen	I️ studied the blade
2017-11-07 20:16:37	jeffrey	Can someone explain to me why microkernels? They seem worse in most ways that matter.
2017-11-07 20:16:51	walter.scheirer	yes, which is why they never caught on
2017-11-07 20:18:58	pbui	Except Minix is on all your intel machines
2017-11-07 20:19:04	jeffrey	Are there any domains where they are widely used? I hear the IME uses some code from MINIX, but I'm not sure how much of that is "we needed an embeddable microkernel OS" and how much is "we needed an embeddable OS"
2017-11-07 20:19:31	walter.scheirer	the intel thing isn't a general purpose OS
2017-11-07 20:19:39	pbui	Qnx is microkernel
2017-11-07 20:19:52	pbui	Used in a lot of industry uses
2017-11-07 20:19:52	walter.scheirer	again, microkernels never caught on...
2017-11-07 20:19:54	walter.scheirer	coughs
2017-11-07 20:20:11	walter.scheirer	i have never seen a commercial deployment of QNX
2017-11-07 20:20:20	androidkitkat	Time to start a business then
2017-11-07 20:20:27	pbui	I think it was in some Ford cars
2017-11-07 20:20:31	walter.scheirer	egad
2017-11-07 20:20:43	jeffrey	Are a lot of RTOSes microkerneled?
2017-11-07 20:20:48	pbui	And a lot of industrial automation stuff
2017-11-07 20:21:10	walter.scheirer	a full OS seems like overkill for many of those applications
2017-11-07 20:21:36	jeffrey	But to me even a microkernel seems a bit much.
2017-11-07 20:22:02	walter.scheirer	when i was in college, the OS classes i took were always like "the microkernel will be standard by 2010"
2017-11-07 20:22:09	walter.scheirer	awful prediction
2017-11-07 20:22:37	jeffrey	Like, I don't know why you would want privilege levels and other things an OS gets you in an embedded system. Maybe to separate mission critical code?
2017-11-07 20:22:54	pbui	QNX is really call
2017-11-07 20:22:56	pbui	or was
2017-11-07 20:23:01	jeffrey	Like, why not have the whole everything be the OS in these systems
2017-11-07 20:23:04	pbui	i ran it as my desktop for a few months in high school
2017-11-07 20:23:26	walter.scheirer	my thoughts on this: academics need stuff to publish about
2017-11-07 20:23:32	walter.scheirer	thus you get microkernels
2017-11-07 20:24:58	walter.scheirer	and Tanenbaum wrote the book
2017-11-07 20:24:59	jeffrey	I read once that Intel expected 10GHz CPUs by like 2010
2017-11-07 20:25:04	walter.scheirer	hence our brainwashing
2017-11-07 20:25:06	pbui	vxworks has "microkernel" profile
2017-11-07 20:25:08	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 20:25:11	pbui	im not sure what that means
2017-11-07 20:25:11	walter.scheirer	10Ghz CPUs
2017-11-07 20:25:27	jeffrey	And this was like, 2003
2017-11-07 20:25:41	walter.scheirer	i'm pretty sure nobody thought we'd do 10Ghz CPUs in 2003
2017-11-07 20:25:44	walter.scheirer	i never head that
2017-11-07 20:25:45	pbui	meh, i think the idea of microkernels lives on, except it's OS and containers
2017-11-07 20:26:15	pbui	walter.scheirer: no, that was a thing (re: CPUs)
2017-11-07 20:26:35	walter.scheirer	really?
2017-11-07 20:26:48	walter.scheirer	the heat would be catastrophic

2017-11-07 20:27:15	walter.scheirer	Intel fans be warned - Fish pulls no punches.
2017-11-07 20:28:24	jeffrey	I had been told if we Moore's Lawed more with clock speed we would have CPUs hotter than the surface of the sun by an EE prof here.
2017-11-07 20:28:52	walter.scheirer	Cache for clunkers
2017-11-07 20:28:55	pbui	when i taught comp arch, i had students read this: http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm 
2017-11-07 20:29:06	walter.scheirer	seriously, who believed we would reach 10Ghz?

2017-11-07 20:29:18	pbui	intel
2017-11-07 20:29:20	pbui	lol
2017-11-07 20:30:09	jeffrey	@walter.scheirer it could have just been marketers
2017-11-07 20:30:31	walter.scheirer	these articles are just discussing the strategies used after we hit some practical limits
2017-11-07 20:30:54	walter.scheirer	@jeffrey: true, i'd maybe believe that
2017-11-07 20:31:23	androidkitkat	@walter.scheirer isnt the highest clock speed like 8 something GHz
2017-11-07 20:32:00	androidkitkat	8.805 GHz wow
2017-11-07 20:32:07	pbui	https://slashdot.org/story/00/12/11/101224/intel-says-10ghz-by-2005 
2017-11-07 20:32:07	jeffrey	On something like liquid nitrogen, right?

2017-11-07 20:32:14	walter.scheirer	yeah, with ridiculous cooling
2017-11-07 20:32:24	androidkitkat	intel you dummy
2017-11-07 20:32:40	walter.scheirer	mid 2011: 128 ghz
2017-11-07 20:32:41	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 20:32:50	androidkitkat	128 GHz wu
2017-11-07 20:32:50	androidkitkat	t
2017-11-07 20:33:39	androidkitkat	i mean i can kinda see where they were coming from
2017-11-07 20:33:40	jeffrey	It's crazy to think that there is an absolute limit to how fast a Turing Machine can run in the real world
2017-11-07 20:34:07	walter.scheirer	so here's a question: can we find something *actually from intel* making these claims?
2017-11-07 20:34:22	androidkitkat	so we can *sue* them?
2017-11-07 20:34:23	walter.scheirer	as much as i trust "geek.com "

2017-11-07 20:35:40	walter.scheirer	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Pollack 
2017-11-07 20:35:47	walter.scheirer	*Pollack worked for Intel and left in 2001.*
2017-11-07 20:35:55	walter.scheirer	possibly in disgrace
2017-11-07 20:36:03	walter.scheirer	for making ludicrous claims
2017-11-07 20:36:08	pbui	pentium pro tho
2017-11-07 20:36:41	jeffrey	The 10 GHz roadmap came from Albert Yu apparently
2017-11-07 20:37:10	pbui	so yeah, this was intel making these claims
2017-11-07 20:37:46	androidkitkat	https://imgur.com/a/jGg6A 
2017-11-07 20:37:55	androidkitkat	this totally real thing
2017-11-07 20:38:30	pbui	i dont speak latin
2017-11-07 20:38:35	pbui	can someone translate?
2017-11-07 20:38:35	androidkitkat	try again
2017-11-07 20:39:28	walter.scheirer	100 Ghz Soon guise
2017-11-07 20:39:55	androidkitkat	you heard it here firstk
2017-11-07 20:40:17	walter.scheirer	i'm really shocked by this intel 10ghz thing
2017-11-07 20:40:23	walter.scheirer	but i guess i shouldn't be
2017-11-07 20:40:27	walter.scheirer	tech is full of ridiculous hype
2017-11-07 20:40:35	pbui	like deep learning
2017-11-07 20:40:37	pbui	:]
2017-11-07 20:40:37	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 20:40:38	walter.scheirer	yes
2017-11-07 20:40:41	walter.scheirer	actually...
2017-11-07 20:40:49	walter.scheirer	that area is one of the worst offendors
2017-11-07 20:40:50	androidkitkat	i'm surprised we havent hit hit yet even with rediculous OC's and insane cooling
2017-11-07 20:40:55	pbui	hey at least i got to ride the cloud hype
2017-11-07 20:41:04	pbui	while i was a grad student
2017-11-07 20:41:05	walter.scheirer	cloud and deep learning are at least things
2017-11-07 20:41:09	walter.scheirer	that work in some capacity
2017-11-07 20:41:15	pbui	which morphed into big data
2017-11-07 20:41:20	pbui	which is now deep learning
2017-11-07 20:41:42	walter.scheirer	some basic knowledge of materials science would easily lead one to believe a 10Ghz silicon chip is not possible
2017-11-07 20:42:00	pbui	but moore's law!
2017-11-07 20:42:03	pbui	it's a law
2017-11-07 20:42:10	androidkitkat	calls 911
2017-11-07 20:42:28	jeffrey	Is a 10GHz "subtract and branch if not 0" machine possible?
2017-11-07 20:42:47	pbui	u know, we misread intel
2017-11-07 20:43:21	pbui	10GHz -> 2Ghz
2017-11-07 20:43:29	pbui	they were talking in binary
2017-11-07 20:43:33	pbui	we just didnt realize it
2017-11-07 20:43:35	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 20:43:42	walter.scheirer	well that explains it!
2017-11-07 20:43:51	pbui	pollack could have kept his job
2017-11-07 20:43:54	jeffrey	But we were at 4GHz by then, why undersell themselves?
2017-11-07 20:43:54	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 20:44:11	walter.scheirer	those 4Ghz P4s were brutal
2017-11-07 20:44:36	androidkitkat	My main rig doesnt even hit 4 GHz...
2017-11-07 20:44:41	androidkitkat	and its Haswell
2017-11-07 20:44:44	walter.scheirer	i can't even imagine doing a data center full of chips with that kind of power requirement these days
2017-11-07 20:45:02	androidkitkat	Large
2017-11-07 20:45:10	jeffrey	I can hit 3.9, didn't try 4, but that would be lucky
2017-11-07 20:45:25	androidkitkat	I dont have an unlocked chipset sadly
2017-11-07 20:45:45	jeffrey	Intel is mean
2017-11-07 20:46:04	androidkitkat	I mean its a lower binned 4790
2017-11-07 20:46:06	androidkitkat	4790k
2017-11-07 20:46:17	pbui	pIII4lyfe
2017-11-07 20:46:19	jeffrey	The 4790 is dope tho
2017-11-07 20:46:27	androidkitkat	it is
2017-11-07 20:46:31	walter.scheirer	this discussion reminds me of transmeta, which was pushing the other way at the same time
2017-11-07 20:46:32	pbui	i loved my thinkpad w/ a p3
2017-11-07 20:46:43	pbui	i took it to psych class and ran netbsd on it
2017-11-07 20:46:52	pbui	and then i spilt soda on it and ruined it
2017-11-07 20:46:52	walter.scheirer	very low-power x86 clones with a lot of software emulation
2017-11-07 20:46:54	pbui	so sad
2017-11-07 20:47:04	walter.scheirer	that company, which employed linus, failed
2017-11-07 20:47:12	walter.scheirer	as Intel was touting it push to 10Ghz
2017-11-07 20:47:13	walter.scheirer	sad
2017-11-07 20:47:28	walter.scheirer	then everything went low power
2017-11-07 20:47:54	pbui	actually the original core arch (post p4) was based on the pIII
2017-11-07 20:47:59	jeffrey	15W ftw
2017-11-07 20:48:08	androidkitkat	Low TDP isnt a bad thing
2017-11-07 20:48:11	pbui	so the p3 gave birth to the modern intel arch
2017-11-07 20:49:13	jeffrey	I am just disappointed with the relatively low clockspeed of Zen
2017-11-07 20:49:52	androidkitkat	More cores tho
2017-11-07 20:49:58	jeffrey	Hopefully AMD feels motivated to give me a 12GHz, 16 core processor for $200 next year tho
2017-11-07 20:50:45	pbui	i just want a ryzen in a laptop w/ a trackpoint
2017-11-07 20:50:58	jeffrey	If the R5-2600 hits say 4.2GHz I'll have to buy one
2017-11-07 20:51:36	pbui	meh, i dont care about speed
2017-11-07 20:51:44	pbui	my laptop is like 5 gen old
2017-11-07 20:51:48	pbui	and i ssh into everything
2017-11-07 20:51:49	jeffrey	On a desktop that's all I care about
2017-11-07 20:51:56	jeffrey	laptop I just care about low power
2017-11-07 20:52:09	androidkitkat	PPC G5 Mobile?
2017-11-07 20:52:11	jeffrey	15W dual core laptop, 65W hexcore desktop
2017-11-07 20:52:14	androidkitkat	best thing
2017-11-07 20:52:26	jeffrey	(with like a 200W GPU)
2017-11-07 20:52:28	pbui	xavier is like 5th gen i think
2017-11-07 20:52:43	androidkitkat	5th gen intel?
2017-11-07 20:52:47	pbui	yeah
2017-11-07 20:52:51	jeffrey	they just released the 8th gen
2017-11-07 20:52:56	jeffrey	and it's just a refresh of a refresh
2017-11-07 20:53:17	pbui	oh, 4th gen? Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz
2017-11-07 20:53:18	jeffrey	(but with 2 more cores, which is nice, but, like, they could have done that whenever they wanted)
2017-11-07 20:53:24	pbui	im happy w/ xavier
2017-11-07 20:53:33	pbui	probably will not upgrade him next year
2017-11-07 20:53:38	androidkitkat	4790 is haswell iirc
2017-11-07 20:53:38	pbui	even though it is my time
2017-11-07 20:53:50	jeffrey	I'm still happy with my home computer's 2600
2017-11-07 20:53:52	pbui	i will maybe use the money to buy another laptop
2017-11-07 20:54:01	pbui	or w/e ND lets me do
2017-11-07 20:54:03	jeffrey	I'm just not home, so can't use it
2017-11-07 20:54:04	androidkitkat	@pbui buy something with Ryzen Mobile
2017-11-07 20:54:07	pbui	has to wait for faculty cycle
2017-11-07 20:54:20	walter.scheirer	what is the faculty cycle?
2017-11-07 20:55:00	pbui	https://oit.nd.edu/services/desktop-mobile-computing-support/ 
2017-11-07 20:55:04	pbui	"The University Campus Workstation Program (CWP) provides funds for a new computer for eligible faculty and staff every four years.  "
2017-11-07 20:55:06	pbui	wait, wtf
2017-11-07 20:55:08	pbui	4 years
2017-11-07 20:55:10	pbui	i thought it was 3
2017-11-07 20:55:12	pbui	oh well
2017-11-07 20:55:19	walter.scheirer	really?
2017-11-07 20:55:34	pbui	i dont have a source of funding...
2017-11-07 20:55:38	walter.scheirer	ah
2017-11-07 20:55:45	pbui	so i use the university resources :]
2017-11-07 20:55:49	pbui	that's how i got xavier
2017-11-07 20:56:22	pbui	man, uwec was on a 3 year cycle
2017-11-07 20:56:41	androidkitkat	sell Linux on the black market
2017-11-07 20:56:43	pbui	i mean, it wasnt necessary, i think xavier can go another 3 years after this, im not in need for more power
2017-11-07 20:56:49	walter.scheirer	we should probably try harder to get equipment donations from companies
2017-11-07 20:56:53	jeffrey	argue that you should count as new faculty since you renewed your contract
2017-11-07 20:57:20	walter.scheirer	when i was at harvard, i remember being stuck in a meeting with intel, where at the end, they revealed they had donated a cluster to us
2017-11-07 20:57:26	walter.scheirer	it was downstairs, being unboxed
2017-11-07 20:57:43	walter.scheirer	it was like an episode of oprah
2017-11-07 20:57:50	jeffrey	and they said, personally, "it will be 10GHz in 10 years"
2017-11-07 20:57:53	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-07 20:57:59	walter.scheirer	then didn't make any insane claims
2017-11-07 21:00:28	pbui	u get a tower, u get a tower, u get a tower...
2017-11-07 21:01:21	walter.scheirer	it was an early installation of xeon phi
2017-11-07 21:01:29	walter.scheirer	i never used the co-processor cards in the nodes though
2017-11-07 21:01:47	walter.scheirer	because the software support was severely lacking
2017-11-07 21:02:10	walter.scheirer	i did make good use of the cpu cores for the main paper from my post doc, however
2017-11-07 21:04:20	walter.scheirer	today's speaker should have been like "u get a titan x, u get a titan x, u get a titan x..."
2017-11-07 21:07:15	androidkitkat	i would have cried
2017-11-07 21:07:27	jeffrey	I would have been mad that I had a research meeting
2017-11-07 21:07:55	androidkitkat	I would even be fine with a 980 TI
2017-11-07 21:08:07	walter.scheirer	there was another time at harvard where steve ballmer came and was throwing xboxes and clippers tickets into the crowd
2017-11-07 21:08:15	walter.scheirer	that was a ridiculous moment
2017-11-07 21:10:23	pbui	clippers tix?
2017-11-07 21:10:26	pbui	lol
2017-11-07 21:10:41	walter.scheirer	celtics vs. clippers
2017-11-07 21:10:43	walter.scheirer	to be precise
2017-11-07 21:13:42	jeffrey	"Fine with a 980TI"
2017-11-07 21:22:43	androidkitkat	yes i would
2017-11-07 21:22:44	androidkitkat	ofc
2017-11-07 21:22:54	androidkitkat	I dont need pascal to be happy
2017-11-07 21:23:40	jeffrey	For free I'd be happy with a 950, or anything cheaper
2017-11-07 21:24:20	pbui	id be happy if i could eat pizza again
2017-11-07 21:24:50	androidkitkat	ill buy you a siggy pizza @pbui

2017-11-07 21:25:31	pbui	aka bullwinkles
2017-11-07 21:25:42	pbui	androidkitkat: are they really just frozen pizza?
2017-11-07 21:25:44	pbui	lol
2017-11-07 21:25:52	androidkitkat	@androidkitkat no theyre hand made
2017-11-07 21:25:55	androidkitkat	cept for the base
2017-11-07 21:26:08	androidkitkat	i was going to work there

2017-11-07 21:29:28	androidkitkat	its a scam
2017-11-07 21:29:38	androidkitkat	they deliver anywhere on campus
2017-11-07 21:29:39	walter.scheirer	Lava sauce?
2017-11-07 21:29:56	androidkitkat	its franks red hot mixed into the sauce
2017-11-07 21:30:02	walter.scheirer	ooofff

2017-11-07 21:30:24	androidkitkat	@jeffrey theyre good for the price honestly
2017-11-07 21:30:34	androidkitkat	just polish one off over a night trying to study
2017-11-07 21:30:59	jeffrey	no I mean, my exroommate and I had ~1.2 Papa Johns per week

2017-11-07 22:11:35	androidkitkat	or do yu just let it chill stock
2017-11-07 22:55:15	wtheisen	there's a tool called TLP that I use
2017-11-07 22:55:17	walter.scheirer	https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/08/meet-the-tech-company-that-wants-to-make-you-even-more-addicted-to-your-phone/ 
2017-11-07 22:55:33	wtheisen	in addition to things like the great suspender for chrome
2017-11-07 22:55:51	walter.scheirer	also, techcrunch could benefit by hiring a few more editors...
2017-11-07 22:55:55	walter.scheirer	that writing is pretty rough
2017-11-07 22:56:55	androidkitkat	TLP isnt being able to be installed
2017-11-07 22:58:17	androidkitkat	pacman -S TLP gives a bunch of 404s
2017-11-07 23:19:09	androidkitkat	guys i might bring someone to lug
2017-11-07 23:19:13	androidkitkat	tomorrow
2017-11-07 23:19:31	jeffrey	sweet
2017-11-07 23:22:56	jeffrey	Guys just when I thought season 2 of stranger things was worse
2017-11-07 23:23:00	jeffrey	it made me so happy
2017-11-07 23:24:47	androidkitkat	im getting him ubuntu in vbox
2017-11-07 23:27:54	jeffrey	I didn't run linux the first 3 or so meetings
2017-11-07 23:28:14	jeffrey	I also skipped 3 meetings between the 1st and 4th
2017-11-07 23:28:19	jeffrey	then the president got mad at me
2017-11-07 23:28:26	jeffrey	so I installed 7 linux VMs
2017-11-07 23:28:41	pbui	androidkitkat: lowercase tlp
2017-11-07 23:29:02	androidkitkat	it fails even when i try it from the AUR gui

2017-11-08 08:51:08	pbui	whenever i see "w/in the hour" i think of jack bauer and 24

2017-11-08 08:55:25	wtheisen	is haskell really an esoteric language?
2017-11-08 08:55:41	pbui	for ND yes
2017-11-08 08:57:30	8bit	It's not whitespace, but it still fits the definition.  But yeah it is a lot more feasible for doing actual things
2017-11-08 09:08:11	walter.scheirer	why didn't ArnoldC make the cut?
2017-11-08 09:08:45	8bit	that's for the advanced esolangs talk
2017-11-08 09:09:02	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-08 09:16:22	dchiang	what are the 4 langs
2017-11-08 09:22:05	bdevorem	Haskell... _esoteric_?!
2017-11-08 09:22:11	bdevorem	Ugh ur killing me
2017-11-08 09:23:57	androidkitkat	@dchiang "Piet, Brainf*ck, Shakespeare Programming Language, Haskell"
2017-11-08 09:33:49	pbui	@bdevorem: be calm
2017-11-08 09:36:14	dougsmith	@bdevorem we teach the controversy. I don't think its totally esoteric, but it's the closest thing we could find to the line that still inspires fights on the internet
2017-11-08 09:38:34	dchiang	wow, one of these is not like the other :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-11-08 09:39:12	dchiang	piet and bf are really fascinating -- i give a homework problem on bf in theory
2017-11-08 09:39:17	dchiang	shakespeare is just for laughs, right?
2017-11-08 09:39:59	dchiang	i would have suggested unlambda
2017-11-08 09:40:31	dchiang	do you know about this? https://github.com/shinh/elvm 
2017-11-08 09:45:42	8bit	That just made my day, the bf problem in theory
2017-11-08 09:46:54	8bit	We sorta figured shakespeare was the mostly joke one, bf was the mostly puzzle one, haskell was the boundary pushing one, piet was the art one.
2017-11-08 09:50:03	pbui	isnt C++ a joke language?
2017-11-08 09:50:25	wtheisen	you're the one teaching it in OS...
2017-11-08 09:50:30	8bit	Did you mean: MATLAB?
2017-11-08 09:50:50	silv3r	LabVIEW
2017-11-08 09:51:12	pbui	isnt javascript a troll language?
2017-11-08 09:53:40	dougsmith	No, I think javascript is what happens when a good general idea is done wrong
2017-11-08 09:53:55	dougsmith	Everything about it is sincere, especially the bad parts
2017-11-08 10:05:47	dchiang	@8bit I have to call it " P'' " though
2017-11-08 10:32:22	8bit	dchiang: I am excited for that problem already, haha.
2017-11-08 10:54:33	ncarroll	how easy in basic?

2017-11-08 11:05:06	flynn	20 GOTO 10
2017-11-08 11:05:39	androidkitkat	this makes a loop
2017-11-08 11:05:48	androidkitkat	if my basic is up to date
2017-11-08 11:06:10	androidkitkat	wait @ncarroll do you want me to teach you german at the same time?
2017-11-08 11:06:15	androidkitkat	what about french?
2017-11-08 11:07:24	ncarroll	apperently basic is the only high level language used by the atari homebrew community
2017-11-08 11:09:23	8bit	I liked that collaboritive devlopment
2017-11-08 11:09:37	androidkitkat	@8bit twitch writes basic?

2017-11-08 14:25:37	abrizius	Carry on
2017-11-08 14:28:37	pbui	just gitlab things
2017-11-08 14:32:19	flynn	Why, computer gurus, does my gadget's autocorrect turn "Biggby", a perfectly good proper noun and the name of a fine coffee chain, into "bigly", an abomination-contraction (allegedly) of "big league"?
2017-11-08 14:33:59	bdevorem	@pbui well it turns out our esoteric rule of 30 tool might actually make it into my research...
2017-11-08 15:09:46	walter.scheirer	i am proud to have taught paradigms that features are faults
2017-11-08 15:53:22	ewilli23	opinion: should I take theory as a cpeg
2017-11-08 15:53:37	wtheisen	no, but ask @ncarroll
2017-11-08 16:10:42	ncarroll	I took theory as a CPEG
2017-11-08 16:11:11	wtheisen	was it worth it? Remember, @dchiang is watching...
2017-11-08 16:11:25	ncarroll	I enjoyed the class
2017-11-08 16:11:50	ncarroll	it was difficult, but it challenged me and helped me understand computers much better
2017-11-08 16:15:45	wtheisen	@ewilli23 I'd recommend you skip theory and just take compilers
2017-11-08 16:18:49	flynn	Why make hard choices? Take both!
2017-11-08 16:19:13	wtheisen	theory is really hard though :grimacing:
2017-11-08 16:19:38	flynn	But it's *fun*
2017-11-08 16:20:46	wtheisen	wait @flynn you worked at OSU? Should I go there for grad school?
2017-11-08 16:28:51	ewilli23	@wtheisen was that sarcastic? I feel like it was
2017-11-08 16:29:49	wtheisen	No, in compilers you'll still get some theory, but then you'll get to see the practical implementation of it
2017-11-08 16:30:36	ewilli23	Is theory not prerequisite for compilers?
2017-11-08 16:30:38	wtheisen	no
2017-11-08 16:34:27	dchiang	not anymore
2017-11-08 16:34:30	dchiang	but it certainly helps
2017-11-08 16:34:59	dchiang	prof. kogge (as a hardware person who has also done some serious theory) strongly believes that cpegs should take theory
2017-11-08 16:36:19	dchiang	my take on it is that the core cse courses teach you how a typical unix workstation is made, from logic gates up to the shell prompt
2017-11-08 16:37:13	dchiang	and the theory sequence mirrors it but on an abstract platform that makes it easier to reason about things
2017-11-08 16:38:02	dchiang	logic design corresponds with the first part of theory (finite automata), architecture corresponds with the third part of theory (Turing machines)
2017-11-08 16:39:03	dchiang	algorithms teaches you how to write efficient software on top of that abstract platform
2017-11-08 16:39:31	dchiang	the point is that in this view of the world, theory is a *hardware* course
2017-11-08 16:40:30	dchiang	it's just that the hardware is rarely actually built

2017-11-08 18:59:56	jeffrey	It's all for a covert operation by AMD
2017-11-08 19:00:46	jeffrey	He just gives them a totally non-clean room implementation, and then AMD sues intel, and he jumps ship back
2017-11-08 19:00:51	jeffrey	It's the perfect crime.

2017-11-08 19:02:54	pbui	like what do we tell students about grad school if this passes
2017-11-08 19:15:31	jeffrey	Is there no work around? Like, have a separate PhD tuition rate of$0?
2017-11-08 19:29:45	bdevorem	@pbui don't go to grad school
2017-11-08 19:30:54	bdevorem	It doesn't seem fair that they want to tax our tuition waiver, but not pay us for all the hours we work
2017-11-08 19:34:00	bdevorem	Sidenote, umass undergrads don't have to take unix, and only one of their courses uses version control to turn in assignments
2017-11-08 19:34:13	bdevorem	And the unix offered is a 1 credit course
2017-11-08 19:34:28	bdevorem	Also sidenote, @ewilli23 take theory

2017-11-08 19:41:17	jeffrey	It's a shame they used a proprietary program for their slides
2017-11-08 19:41:39	walter.scheirer	and proprietary OS
2017-11-08 19:42:02	jeffrey	They at least tried not to
2017-11-08 19:42:14	jeffrey	It's really ND's fault for not respecting our freedom
2017-11-08 19:43:15	pbui	@bdevorem: is that a good thing (re: unix)
2017-11-08 19:43:29	pbui	bdevorem: what would u do if the tax plan passes?
2017-11-08 20:21:20	walter.scheirer	note that the university is far more worried about the endowment tax
2017-11-08 20:22:17	tweninger	who told you this? they shouldn't be
2017-11-08 20:22:36	tweninger	a 1.5% tax definately sucks, but eliminating graduate degrees kills the university
2017-11-08 20:22:45	walter.scheirer	somebody didn't go to the president's address last night...
2017-11-08 20:22:50	tweninger	i did not :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-11-08 20:23:06	tweninger	what was said about this?
2017-11-08 20:23:15	walter.scheirer	one thing notre dame could do is make graduate school free
2017-11-08 20:23:27	walter.scheirer	the tuition money is funny money here
2017-11-08 20:23:34	walter.scheirer	we don't pay it out of research dollars
2017-11-08 20:23:43	walter.scheirer	i suspect they would do that
2017-11-08 20:23:45	walter.scheirer	and the problem is solved
2017-11-08 20:23:53	tweninger	thats easy enough... but does it fly with law school etc?
2017-11-08 20:24:16	walter.scheirer	the professional students are taking out loans anyway
2017-11-08 20:24:20	walter.scheirer	i don't think it would slow them down
2017-11-08 20:24:34	tweninger	I always wondered why we do the waiver thing the way that we do
2017-11-08 20:24:52	tweninger	is it a funny way to keep accounting tidy?
2017-11-08 20:25:02	walter.scheirer	the waiver makes us more competitive
2017-11-08 20:25:13	walter.scheirer	when we apply for grants and research contracts
2017-11-08 20:25:22	tweninger	well sure, but why do we have the waiver instead of just not charging tuition?
2017-11-08 20:25:31	tweninger	its a distinction without a difference
2017-11-08 20:25:36	walter.scheirer	because we have an option
2017-11-08 20:25:38	walter.scheirer	for students to pay
2017-11-08 20:25:45	walter.scheirer	it's just rarely exercised in engineering
2017-11-08 20:26:01	walter.scheirer	there may be some other accounting reason
2017-11-08 20:26:09	walter.scheirer	but these are the explanations i've heard
2017-11-08 20:26:13	tweninger	ok - makes sense to me
2017-11-08 20:26:32	tweninger	go on about the excise tax
2017-11-08 20:26:54	tweninger	what was said?
2017-11-08 20:27:53	walter.scheirer	it's going to be a drag on the budget
2017-11-08 20:28:12	walter.scheirer	he also pledged to cut the university budget
2017-11-08 20:28:28	walter.scheirer	to brace for a possible market downturn
2017-11-08 20:28:37	walter.scheirer	around the same time a tax would take effect
2017-11-08 20:29:01	walter.scheirer	though that might be a hedge against the tax
2017-11-08 20:30:21	tweninger	anything specific or just an across the board cut?
2017-11-08 20:30:27	walter.scheirer	he didn't mention specifics
2017-11-08 20:30:43	pbui	budget cuts?
2017-11-08 20:30:44	pbui	rip
2017-11-08 20:30:50	walter.scheirer	he was pretty insistent on that
2017-11-08 20:30:57	pbui	also, i just allocated 1TB of VM on student00
2017-11-08 20:30:59	pbui	lol
2017-11-08 20:31:09	tweninger	well our "nonessential" budget is incredible
2017-11-08 20:31:10	walter.scheirer	father john is going to cut that allocation
2017-11-08 20:31:27	tweninger	we spent 50K (I think) on tulips last year
2017-11-08 20:31:32	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-08 20:31:52	walter.scheirer	i've noticed that we've been cutting back on social functions lately
2017-11-08 20:32:01	walter.scheirer	for instance, there was no reception after the talk last night
2017-11-08 20:32:15	walter.scheirer	we were given the option of staying for the faculty senate meeting
2017-11-08 20:32:24	walter.scheirer	i ran out of there as soon as i could
2017-11-08 20:32:39	tweninger	well that could also be because the rising cost of the catering service
2017-11-08 20:33:52	tweninger	we've spent a lot of money on physical buildings recently, now we have to maintain them
2017-11-08 20:34:05	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-11-08 20:34:24	tweninger	that'll eat up the budget a bit more... but I think its smart to invest in durable things during a market high
2017-11-08 20:34:44	tweninger	buildings dont depreciate any faster in a recession
2017-11-08 20:43:36	walter.scheirer	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/08/world/europe/pope-phones-mass.html 
2017-11-08 20:52:25	pbui	also, doesnt that say something if ND is preparing for a economic downturn due to these tax cuts
2017-11-08 20:52:44	pbui	when these tax cuts are being promised to unleash economic growth?
2017-11-08 20:55:06	tweninger	well I think they two might be unrelated. Bush tax cuts were followed by great recession. Reagans cuts had some decent growth
2017-11-08 20:55:41	tweninger	i'm no economist, but it just seems that economy is cyclical and we're at a peak right now
2017-11-08 20:55:56	ncarroll	time to short all the stocks
2017-11-08 20:56:22	tweninger	Hey Bui can I borrow 100K to short SNAP
2017-11-08 20:56:35	walter.scheirer	tencent just dumped a ton of money into them
2017-11-08 20:56:56	walter.scheirer	undervalued!
2017-11-08 20:57:23	tweninger	I'm pretty convinced that twitter, snap, et all will be bankrupt or absorbed into the Google-borg soon
2017-11-08 20:58:35	pbui	u mean alphabet
2017-11-08 20:58:40	pbui	:]
2017-11-08 20:59:41	tweninger	ugh
2017-11-08 21:01:25	tweninger	SNAP grew at 2.x% last quarter - still 3 orders of magnitude smaller than facebook with no monetization strategy
2017-11-08 21:01:38	ncarroll	my biggest stock win was buying take two before grand theft auto 5 came out
2017-11-08 21:01:57	tweninger	i own stock in take two too
2017-11-08 21:02:19	walter.scheirer	index funds people
2017-11-08 21:02:31	tweninger	(buy index funds and you can answer yes to all of them)

2017-11-08 21:03:52	tweninger	^^ <- this
2017-11-08 21:04:50	tweninger	That and Walter's incredible Beany Baby collection
2017-11-08 21:05:01	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-08 21:05:10	walter.scheirer	don't criticize my nest egg
2017-11-08 21:05:13	pbui	i want in on this beany baby collection
2017-11-08 21:05:19	pbui	can i contribute my baseball cards?
2017-11-08 21:05:23	pbui	and my comic books?
2017-11-08 21:05:25	walter.scheirer	sure
2017-11-08 21:06:09	mflanag6	I have a great collection of old fast food receipts, any takers?
2017-11-08 21:06:36	walter.scheirer	"vintage" receipts
2017-11-08 21:08:30	androidkitkat	@mflanag6 about three fifty?
2017-11-08 21:08:53	mflanag6	yeah, 350 grand ought to do it
2017-11-08 21:09:07	tweninger	I think Bui's and my own baseball card collections can be combined into a basket and we can sell derivatives on the market.
2017-11-08 21:09:27	tweninger	bring the market down again
2017-11-08 21:09:33	mflanag6	you only want to bundle because your collection is subprime
2017-11-08 21:09:47	tweninger	subprime baseball card backed securities
2017-11-08 21:11:10	mflanag6	I'd invest
2017-11-08 21:12:51	tweninger	I'll get moody's on the line. Maybe kick in my Barry Bonds rookie card for that AAA rating
2017-11-08 21:13:26	walter.scheirer	we'll bail out ND's budget with this baseball card investment scheme
2017-11-08 21:52:21	flynn	@wtheisen I was an EE prof at OSU almost 20 years ago. Good school. Very big.  But I like it at ND better (left there to come here). CSE dept also good.

2017-11-08 22:54:13	androidkitkat	what vidyas
2017-11-08 23:14:11	ncarroll	all of them
2017-11-08 23:17:00	androidkitkat	about 9
2017-11-08 23:20:58	mflanag6	@walter.scheirer do you live at the foundry?
2017-11-08 23:38:48	wtheisen	Game over! Someone has obtained fully functional JTAG for Intel CSME via USB DCI
2017-11-08 23:38:48	wtheisen	https://twitter.com/h0t_max/status/928269320064450560 
2017-11-08 23:39:39	jeffrey	They used a standard debugger?
2017-11-08 23:40:39	jeffrey	I would have assumed intel would use some proprietary nonsense, or totally disable the debugger on their "security through obscurity" chip inside a chip
2017-11-09 07:40:27	walter.scheirer	i do indeed live at the foundry
2017-11-09 07:40:42	walter.scheirer	which had functional comcast service as of this morning...
2017-11-09 09:19:19	ewilli23	@pbui is “The Past, Present, and Future of Computing” the video game history course you were talking about?
2017-11-09 09:20:13	ewilli23	Also what are the chances either the drone or droid class doesn’t fill up with seniors?
2017-11-09 09:20:31	flynn	@ncarroll never studied that, suspect some are valuable but most not
2017-11-09 09:21:29	wtheisen	I don't think the droid one will fill up *that* quickly. The description made it sound like you have to be really dedicated
2017-11-09 09:21:43	wtheisen	which second semester seniors aren't really about afaik
2017-11-09 09:52:09	bdevorem	@pbui re unix: I think it should be required. Re tax plan: not sure what i would do. It depends on what Umass does in return. We have a really good grad student union that tries really hard to make grad school a decent option for us and they bargain weekly. But it's hard to tell what actually would happen, so I'm not sure what i would do. I want to be a prof, so I kinda have to grad school...
2017-11-09 10:06:34	dchiang	i feel pretty optimistic that one of the following will happen:  (1) the tax plan fails (2) this provision is removed (3) universities reduce tuition for phd students (4) phd stipends go up to compensate
2017-11-09 10:25:18	flynn	Agree completely. Some univs may decide to deemphasize PhD programs but many will make adjustments.
2017-11-09 10:43:14	walter.scheirer	i agree with this as well @dchiang
2017-11-09 10:43:46	walter.scheirer	(1) is a high probability event
2017-11-09 12:26:04	mflanag6	@walter.scheirer how is the foundry?  I am looking into living there next year
2017-11-09 12:34:51	pbui	@ewilli23: yes
2017-11-09 12:46:38	androidkitkat	i love fixing my problems
2017-11-09 14:36:57	ewilli23	@pbui so why doesn’t the course description mention gaming? it’s just like “we’ll examine computing and a particular subfield” but is super vague
2017-11-09 14:38:25	wtheisen	because it keeps all the @ncarroll s from signing up and it’s easier to convince the department to allow it
2017-11-09 14:39:23	walter.scheirer	@mflanag6: the foundry is pretty sweet
2017-11-09 14:39:30	walter.scheirer	are you going to be my neighbor?
2017-11-09 14:41:24	pbui	@ewilli23: it's so it can serve as the generic course description
2017-11-09 14:41:39	pbui	and then the instructor of that course can focus it on a particular topic
2017-11-09 14:42:19	pbui	this allows us to offer similar classes under the same course number
2017-11-09 14:42:27	ewilli23	Ohh, interesting
2017-11-09 14:42:42	pbui	so in the future someone may choose to do a different history of computing course
2017-11-09 14:42:53	pbui	like on say programming languages
2017-11-09 14:43:09	pbui	and we dont have to change the course description or allocate a new course number
2017-11-09 15:20:05	mflanag6	@walter.scheirer if I am your neighbor will you help me with my homework?
2017-11-09 15:28:42	walter.scheirer	lol

2017-11-09 20:47:01	walter.scheirer	but only TOS, TNG and DS9
2017-11-09 20:47:17	jeffrey	Voyager is the best Star Track
2017-11-09 20:47:21	jbaker10	@walter.scheirer why haven't we published together? I asked like weeks ago :(((((
2017-11-09 20:47:25	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-09 20:47:54	jbaker10	My grad app will be a failure without this paper
2017-11-09 20:48:09	jeffrey	(voyager is the worst star trek, I've only liked TOS and TNG)
2017-11-09 20:48:53	walter.scheirer	good man
2017-11-09 20:49:11	walter.scheirer	enterprise was pretty lousy too
2017-11-09 20:49:18	walter.scheirer	and everything else after that i never watched
2017-11-09 20:52:02	pbui	squints, decides it's not worth it
2017-11-09 20:55:27	jeffrey	I haven't seen DS9, and couldn't watch enterprise
2017-11-09 20:55:46	walter.scheirer	DS9 is pretty good
2017-11-09 20:56:00	walter.scheirer	it's really an extension of TNG
2017-11-09 21:10:48	alitteke	There are some good Voyager Episodes
2017-11-09 21:11:34	ccarball	ooh next generation is lit

2017-11-09 22:59:50	wtheisen	and it works, I'm saying an extra hail mary tonight
2017-11-09 23:00:44	alitteke	I’m still battling seg faults for arrays
2017-11-09 23:01:16	wtheisen	arrays are what I spent like the last 4 hours on, mine were completely busted from last week so I had to re-write half my parser
2017-11-09 23:02:07	wtheisen	good luck @alitteke
2017-11-09 23:04:08	walter.scheirer	and comcast is out again at the foundry...

2017-11-10 17:39:39	ewilli23	Wait how did I miss the Star Trek conversation
2017-11-10 17:40:04	ewilli23	_adds Star Trek to list of ping words_
2017-11-10 17:40:39	ewilli23	Unpopular opinion: Enterprise was good
2017-11-10 17:42:04	walter.scheirer	@pbui: tell us of your start-up
2017-11-10 18:09:27	pbui	@wtheisen: that bad at teaching huh?
2017-11-10 18:09:36	pbui	I guess I should consider it
2017-11-10 18:09:53	wtheisen	they  just can't understand that you can work for so little money
2017-11-10 18:10:22	silv3r	:dollar:
2017-11-10 18:10:53	pbui	What
2017-11-10 18:11:21	pbui	Anyway, next week I'm going to show the os class how to setup raid on a rpi
2017-11-10 18:11:22	silv3r	I heard the universities 401k matching is real nice tho
2017-11-10 18:11:39	pbui	And how to rebuild the array if u lose a disk
2017-11-10 18:14:19	androidkitkat	wait @pbui thats so cool
2017-11-10 18:14:39	androidkitkat	when is this
2017-11-10 18:14:55	pbui	Also, might show them how to write a simple Linux device driver
2017-11-10 18:15:09	pbui	Like a fake character device
2017-11-10 18:15:22	pbui	I'll do raid on Thurs
2017-11-10 18:15:39	androidkitkat	what time
2017-11-10 18:16:16	ewilli23	9:30
2017-11-10 18:16:57	androidkitkat	anything with RAID is cool

2017-11-10 18:40:30	pbui	maybe your wifi problem will be fixed in the new networkmanager
2017-11-10 18:41:21	pbui	@alitteke: yep, basically me

2017-11-10 18:42:52	pbui	i used the lena picture in my master's thesis
2017-11-10 18:44:59	androidkitkat	\o/
2017-11-10 18:45:25	pbui	the new networkmanager is in testing, so it should hit the repos in a few days
2017-11-10 18:46:17	pbui	@alitteke: @jbaker10 http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/53374.wss  seems relevant to u
2017-11-10 18:54:27	jbaker10	Sigh. I'm just so behind :(
2017-11-10 19:01:43	jbaker10	I'll never amount to anything

2017-11-10 23:09:53	jeffrey	With my trash python code
2017-11-10 23:12:22	pbui	Yeah I was looking at it
2017-11-10 23:13:10	pbui	I kinda want to make one now
2017-11-10 23:19:59	jeffrey	Do it, and we can do a follow up blog post of a few languages people made
2017-11-10 23:23:22	wtheisen	pfff contribute to lightning instead, join the threaded side
2017-11-10 23:23:33	jeffrey	Lol
2017-11-11 11:32:43	wtheisen	man grad applications suck
2017-11-11 11:35:27	androidkitkat	i thought grad school was a waste of time and you learn all the stuff you need by reading papers
2017-11-11 11:37:29	wtheisen	exactly, make more money that way too so you don't have to be poor like pbui or @walter.scheirer
2017-11-11 11:54:29	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-11 13:23:52	pbui	@pbui uploaded a file: IMG_20171111_132253371.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0HK21CP2/F7ZLP4X1U/img_20171111_132253371.jpg 
2017-11-11 13:24:29	pbui	@wtheisen: i dont think walter.scheirer or i are poor, not to brag, just trying to correct the record
2017-11-11 13:24:42	pbui	it's true we could make more money in industry, but money isnt everything
2017-11-11 13:25:24	pbui	i make "enough" to be satisfied, and my job has priceless benefits and advantages
2017-11-11 13:26:58	pbui	u will not be making bank as a grad student, that is true
2017-11-11 13:27:06	pbui	but post-grad school, u ll be fine
2017-11-11 13:27:29	wtheisen	haha I'm just giving you  a hard time, ND students care too much about money
2017-11-11 13:27:48	pbui	industry only has two advantages for me...
2017-11-11 13:27:52	pbui	1. money, which i dont care about
2017-11-11 13:27:59	pbui	2. location, which i do care about
2017-11-11 13:28:25	pbui	so... if i were to go to industry it would not be for the money
2017-11-11 13:28:33	pbui	:]
2017-11-11 13:29:09	androidkitkat	thats a good way to look at it
2017-11-11 14:03:47	jbaker10	@pbui am I approved for the game course??
2017-11-11 14:12:19	pbui	Dunno
2017-11-11 14:21:52	walter.scheirer	Agree with @pbui: I’m not in this for the money
2017-11-11 14:27:50	walter.scheirer	The salaries in industry are substantially higher for folks coming out of grad school
2017-11-11 14:28:16	walter.scheirer	There’s incredible demand for PhD level people in certain subfields of CS
2017-11-11 14:28:30	silv3r	What is substantial? Double? 50% increase?
2017-11-11 14:29:01	silv3r	Batrick made it seem like it wasn’t that much extra, but that the reward would be the ability to do more interesting or cutting edge work
2017-11-11 14:29:41	walter.scheirer	For vision / AI it could be 3-4x compared to only having a BS
2017-11-11 14:29:45	walter.scheirer	For instance
2017-11-11 14:29:47	silv3r	Wow
2017-11-11 14:29:58	walter.scheirer	Some folks can command much more than that
2017-11-11 14:30:09	walter.scheirer	But there is a lot of variance
2017-11-11 14:31:27	silv3r	I am assuming the newer / ‘hot’ fields value PhDs more?
2017-11-11 14:31:28	walter.scheirer	Other hot subfields: security, HCI, data science
2017-11-11 14:31:33	walter.scheirer	Yeah
2017-11-11 14:31:41	silv3r	What is HCI?
2017-11-11 14:32:03	walter.scheirer	Though most folks in other subfields are rebranding themselves as data scientists
2017-11-11 14:32:11	cgiuffrida	Does a masters in CS mean anything in industry?
2017-11-11 14:32:16	walter.scheirer	When they hit the job market
2017-11-11 14:32:24	walter.scheirer	Human computer interaction
2017-11-11 14:32:35	walter.scheirer	Robotics is also very hot right now
2017-11-11 14:32:56	walter.scheirer	There’s more debate over the MS
2017-11-11 14:33:13	walter.scheirer	In the past, it used to count as 5 years of experience
2017-11-11 14:33:34	walter.scheirer	Thus it provided a decent bump in position and pay
2017-11-11 14:33:46	walter.scheirer	That’s becoming less true these days
2017-11-11 14:33:54	walter.scheirer	But it still has value
2017-11-11 14:34:11	walter.scheirer	Depending on the position
2017-11-11 14:34:23	walter.scheirer	Still true in the government world
2017-11-11 14:34:28	androidkitkat	^
2017-11-11 14:34:28	walter.scheirer	I’d say
2017-11-11 14:34:45	androidkitkat	Expeirence is everything in govt afaik
2017-11-11 14:34:55	walter.scheirer	If you do a specialized MS, it could be a huge boost
2017-11-11 14:35:14	walter.scheirer	Like an MS in infosec
2017-11-11 14:35:33	androidkitkat	You can also go govt contractor
2017-11-11 14:35:49	androidkitkat	and make 10x the money doing the exact thing youd do as a govt employee
2017-11-11 14:35:54	androidkitkat	not 10x but you know
2017-11-11 14:35:55	walter.scheirer	Sigh, a maintenance crew is inspecting this plane I’m sitting in
2017-11-11 14:36:17	walter.scheirer	By government work, I really mean contracting
2017-11-11 14:36:23	androidkitkat	Ah
2017-11-11 14:36:29	androidkitkat	not as a govt employee
2017-11-11 14:36:44	walter.scheirer	There are very few true government positions these days
2017-11-11 14:37:06	androidkitkat	i want to work govt
2017-11-11 14:37:17	androidkitkat	just like all my siblings lol
2017-11-11 14:39:04	walter.scheirer	The captain just came on to tell us that the maintenance team is looking for something that goes by a giant acronym
2017-11-11 14:39:08	cgiuffrida	Is it possible to learn on the job the types of things you would learn getting a PhD and still be qualified for a similar job, or is that unheard of?
2017-11-11 14:39:21	androidkitkat	@walter.scheirer better than it being lost
2017-11-11 14:39:22	walter.scheirer	Not sure if I should feel safe
2017-11-11 14:39:36	androidkitkat	how often do you fly?
2017-11-11 14:39:44	androidkitkat	bc you have lots of plane issues
2017-11-11 14:40:00	walter.scheirer	@cgiuffrida: maybe, but a PhD program does often impart special skills
2017-11-11 14:40:09	walter.scheirer	That are not easily learned in industry
2017-11-11 14:40:31	silv3r	Can these be gained by reading papers
2017-11-11 14:40:32	walter.scheirer	This semester, I’ve been flying weekly
2017-11-11 14:40:36	androidkitkat	yuck
2017-11-11 14:40:49	silv3r	Dem frequent flyer miles tho
2017-11-11 14:40:51	walter.scheirer	You can’t just read the papers
2017-11-11 14:40:58	androidkitkat	you need to write the papers
2017-11-11 14:41:08	walter.scheirer	Interacting with peers in a research setting is critical
2017-11-11 14:41:17	walter.scheirer	And writing those papers...
2017-11-11 14:44:23	walter.scheirer	Yay, taking off
2017-11-11 14:46:30	androidkitkat	so they found the acronym hopefully
2017-11-11 15:51:12	pbui	sent from a friend: https://twitter.com/hashtagoras/status/929344296951713794

2017-11-11 16:31:03	dchiang	@silv3r @walter.scheirer I think deep learning is kind of a special case right now though, right?
2017-11-11 16:31:40	walter.scheirer	For the highest salaries, yes
2017-11-11 16:31:44	dchiang	I believe 2x might be possible too
2017-11-11 16:32:55	walter.scheirer	Some of the Chinese AI companies are starting fresh phds at $400k
2017-11-11 16:33:03	walter.scheirer	Which seems unbelievable
2017-11-11 16:33:04	dchiang	Oh wow
2017-11-11 16:33:07	walter.scheirer	But is real...
2017-11-11 16:33:23	walter.scheirer	They’re outbidding American tech companies
2017-11-11 16:33:28	pbui	starts sitting in on some deep learning classes
2017-11-11 16:33:35	walter.scheirer	Lol
2017-11-11 16:33:52	dchiang	I know someone who went to Google brain for just under 300 and I thought that was a lot
2017-11-11 16:34:36	dchiang	And i know someone also in ai at google but not so into deep learning who got upper 100s
2017-11-11 16:34:40	wtheisen	holy guacamole hi @walter.scheirer it’s me ur AI phd student
2017-11-11 16:34:42	walter.scheirer	Offset some of these salaries with the cost of living in the Bay Area though
2017-11-11 16:34:57	dchiang	Bachelors is like 100 right?
2017-11-11 16:35:01	walter.scheirer	Yeah
2017-11-11 16:35:08	walter.scheirer	That’s pretty routine
2017-11-11 16:35:38	pbui	my friend is considering buying a house in the valley, said he has to put 250k down
2017-11-11 16:35:45	pbui	DOWN
2017-11-11 16:35:50	pbui	as in like 20%
2017-11-11 16:36:02	pbui	i was like... u just bought my house
2017-11-11 16:37:54	walter.scheirer	That’s brutal
2017-11-11 16:38:11	dougsmith	I have no sense of finance and I know that that's a lot.
2017-11-11 16:38:36	pbui	then again 250k is 4 years at ND...
2017-11-11 16:38:52	pbui	(too soon?)
2017-11-11 16:42:29	jeffrey	yes
2017-11-11 16:45:53	walter.scheirer	Haha
2017-11-11 17:10:18	flynn	When I lived in the valley last year my monthly rent on a 1-bedroom OK apartment across the street from the Caltrain tracks was $3000/month. That was 50% more than my house payment here.
2017-11-11 17:10:40	flynn	You have to get used to money numbers meaning something very different out there.
2017-11-11 17:11:31	wtheisen	Do I keep working on my apps for slack off and play video games?
2017-11-11 17:12:07	pbui	fyi, georgia is choking, iowa is disappointing
2017-11-11 17:13:23	flynn	If you bring midwestern or southern sensibilities out there you will have to come to terms with the difference and it is significant. on everything. coin operated laundry. Cereal. Gas. But it is an exciting place in a lot of ways, right @ncarroll? and I am sure some of the jobs can be incredibly rewarding. Many of the jobs destroy work/life balance completely though. I saw many people almost brag about how they have no life outside of work.
2017-11-11 17:46:59	jeffrey	wait the "choose all that apply" GRE questions are all or nothing?
2017-11-11 17:47:12	wtheisen	yes it's so dumb
2017-11-11 17:47:33	pbui	georgia is ruining everything
2017-11-11 17:47:39	pbui	iowa is making progress
2017-11-11 17:49:19	pbui	wow... iowa...
2017-11-11 17:52:52	jeffrey	Most of my verbal wrong answers on the practice test were "you didn't choose them all" :disappointed:
2017-11-11 17:53:13	wtheisen	the verbal is so tricky
2017-11-11 17:53:34	jeffrey	They use so many words I don't know, like "acumin
2017-11-11 17:53:46	jeffrey	"acumen"*
2017-11-11 17:54:04	jeffrey	"the"
2017-11-11 17:54:04	wtheisen	I always thought I had a pretty good vocabulary before I took those
2017-11-11 17:54:37	jeffrey	I know mine sucks. I am really going to have to rely on "I know these answers are wrong"
2017-11-11 17:55:01	jeffrey	"I know this word fits, and this other word I don't know, so I'll go with those two"
2017-11-11 18:20:29	pbui	man, chromium eats so much memory
2017-11-11 18:20:43	pbui	my wife's computer is in the swap and all it's doing its running chromium
2017-11-11 18:20:50	pbui	she has a gazillion tabs though
2017-11-11 18:24:32	jeffrey	@jeffrey uploaded a file: something pbui said earlier reminded me ofthis https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0L54J0MD/F7Y6B5T7S/screenshot_20161023-235918.jpg 
2017-11-11 18:38:40	dchiang	Won't Georgia's loss hurt us though?
2017-11-11 18:40:43	pbui	i think it does
2017-11-11 18:40:47	pbui	unfortunately
2017-11-11 18:40:54	mflanag6	georgia lost?!
2017-11-11 18:41:03	pbui	they are getting destroyed
2017-11-11 18:41:12	wtheisen	if we win out there’s no way we aren’t in
2017-11-11 18:41:14	mflanag6	holy smokes
2017-11-11 18:41:25	pbui	wisconsin is destroying iowa too
2017-11-11 18:41:33	mflanag6	sparty also got demolished
2017-11-11 18:42:09	mflanag6	all we can do is hold up our end
2017-11-11 18:46:42	walter.scheirer	That hurts our ranking
2017-11-11 18:46:44	jeffrey	here's the scenario in which georgia's loss can be good: they still play in the sec championship, but beat bama
2017-11-11 18:46:44	walter.scheirer	Potentially
2017-11-11 18:47:35	walter.scheirer	Wow, I just looked at the score
2017-11-11 18:48:01	pbui	or bama beats them
2017-11-11 18:48:07	pbui	i think that's ok for us
2017-11-11 18:48:17	walter.scheirer	I’m at a dinner in DuPont circle, which I hope doesn’t go too long
2017-11-11 18:48:22	pbui	b/c 10-1 ND gets in over -2 georgia
2017-11-11 18:48:30	walter.scheirer	Because I need to watch the game
2017-11-11 18:48:37	pbui	but does 10-1 ND get over -1 alabama?
2017-11-11 18:48:39	pbui	probably not
2017-11-11 18:48:55	wtheisen	at least they got BTFOed by #10
2017-11-11 18:48:56	walter.scheirer	Doesn’t Alabama still have to play auburn?
2017-11-11 18:49:55	pbui	yeah
2017-11-11 18:50:04	pbui	this just goes to show u how volatile cfb is
2017-11-11 18:50:08	walter.scheirer	Yep
2017-11-11 18:50:14	pbui	i wouldnt be surprised of any outcome tonight
2017-11-11 18:50:17	walter.scheirer	Hah
2017-11-11 18:50:27	walter.scheirer	We beat Miami last year
2017-11-11 18:50:39	walter.scheirer	Maybe a good sign?
2017-11-11 18:50:42	pbui	maybe
2017-11-11 18:51:06	pbui	im just worried that we havent really had a close game, like how will we respond if we go down early
2017-11-11 18:51:18	pbui	i mean besides the georgia game
2017-11-11 18:51:26	jeffrey	we were the last team to beat miami, right?
2017-11-11 18:51:31	pbui	yes
2017-11-11 18:51:45	wtheisen	we went down last week
2017-11-11 18:51:57	jeffrey	nah
2017-11-11 18:52:33	pbui	in the mean time... ive moved from evdev/synaptics to libinput
2017-11-11 18:52:38	pbui	woo, im now living in the future
2017-11-11 18:58:34	walter.scheirer	Ha
2017-11-11 18:58:50	walter.scheirer	How is ND football doing in the future?
2017-11-11 18:59:59	pbui	reply hazy, try again in 4 hours
2017-11-11 19:01:39	pbui	wait, usc is still ranked no. 11?
2017-11-11 19:01:41	pbui	how
2017-11-11 19:07:06	walter.scheirer	Haha
2017-11-11 19:07:23	walter.scheirer	These rankings are so unscientific
2017-11-11 19:08:01	walter.scheirer	There’s probably a D3 school out there that is truly good and undefeated
2017-11-11 19:08:19	walter.scheirer	Who could cream and of the top 4
2017-11-11 19:08:52	pbui	i just think 11 is high for a 2 loss usc
2017-11-11 19:39:29	walter.scheirer	Still at this dinner
2017-11-11 19:39:44	walter.scheirer	Need to get back before kickoff...
2017-11-11 19:47:18	pbui	from @flynn: https://cra.org/cra-statement-us-news-world-report-rankings-computer-science-universities/ 
2017-11-11 19:47:30	pbui	"The methodology used — rankings based on journal publications collected by Web of Science — ignores conference publications and as a consequence does not accurately reflect how research is disseminated in the CS community or how faculty receive recognition or have impact."
2017-11-11 19:47:32	pbui	wtf
2017-11-11 19:48:03	pbui	all through grad school i was told dont bother w/ journals, focus on conferences (which i think is the normal for CS)
2017-11-11 19:48:10	pbui	and this ranking doesnt index conferences?
2017-11-11 19:51:53	walter.scheirer	We’re not even listed
2017-11-11 19:52:05	pbui	https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/articles/subject-rankings-methodology 
2017-11-11 19:52:59	walter.scheirer	This is worse than the college football playoff ranking
2017-11-11 19:55:20	pbui	im also uneasy w/ the research publication as proxy for quality
2017-11-11 19:56:00	flynn	Um we are ranked 60 out of 176 for CS grad progs which is what cra is objecting to
2017-11-11 19:57:51	pbui	the cra article mentions the global list
2017-11-11 19:57:54	pbui	which we are not on
2017-11-11 19:58:53	flynn	Oh I see. That is seriously weird but whatever
2017-11-11 19:58:59	pbui	we are 60 in the grad school CS: https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings 
2017-11-11 19:59:04	pbui	but that is date 2014
2017-11-11 19:59:10	pbui	in the new global list, we are not on it
2017-11-11 20:00:13	pbui	https://www.usnews.com/education/best-global-universities/computer-science 
2017-11-11 20:00:21	pbui	in the global list UT austin is no. 2 in the world
2017-11-11 20:00:31	pbui	in the grad school list, they are no. 9
2017-11-11 20:01:07	pbui	speaking of rankings, game is finally on

2017-11-11 20:07:22	pbui	im sure it will
2017-11-11 20:15:32	walter.scheirer	The global ranking is all sorts of crazy

2017-11-11 20:21:18	pbui	dang, had him
2017-11-11 20:21:26	wtheisen	we're taking a lot of high hits, those head bonks scare me
2017-11-11 20:22:14	flynn	Miami’s secondaries playing very physical. Waiting for the flags to start
2017-11-11 20:23:24	pbui	ok, lets go d
2017-11-11 20:24:04	flynn	Long field for Miami

2017-11-11 20:34:37	walter.scheirer	Hopefully I will get back for the second quarter
2017-11-11 20:35:13	flynn	Trying to make sense of the Star Wars Nissan commercial
2017-11-11 20:36:01	flynn	that they are playing every 10 minutes during the game
2017-11-11 20:37:05	wtheisen	I've seen that commercial more than I've seen first downs
2017-11-11 20:38:50	pbui	speaking of which...
2017-11-11 20:38:52	pbui	sigh
2017-11-11 20:39:14	flynn	The option? Really?
2017-11-11 20:39:22	pbui	80s throwback
2017-11-11 20:39:54	flynn	On 3rd and short...

2017-11-11 20:52:59	wtheisen	welp, it was coming
2017-11-11 20:54:43	flynn	Yikes
2017-11-11 20:57:47	pbui	this feels like the alabama NC game
2017-11-11 21:04:05	walter.scheirer	Finally made it back to my hotel... to this
2017-11-11 21:04:15	walter.scheirer	facepalms

2017-11-11 21:09:09	wtheisen	my stream is so far behind

2017-11-11 21:11:13	wtheisen	@abrizius hold a golf club out your window I'm sure that'll work
2017-11-11 21:12:11	wtheisen	hopefully once my download finishes it'll stop freezing
2017-11-11 21:12:13	abrizius	You need a TV for that
2017-11-11 21:14:36	pbui	wow
2017-11-11 21:15:32	abrizius	> 4th and inches

2017-11-11 21:19:33	pbui	ugh, short
2017-11-11 21:19:48	walter.scheirer	And the power just went out in my hotel...
2017-11-11 21:20:10	pbui	false start...
2017-11-11 21:23:48	walter.scheirer	Maybe it’s for the best that I don’t see the conclusion of this game
2017-11-11 21:24:02	pbui	have faith
2017-11-11 21:24:41	walter.scheirer	Haha
2017-11-11 21:29:49	pbui	wtf

2017-11-11 21:30:29	abrizius	Hmm
2017-11-11 21:34:31	walter.scheirer	0-20...
2017-11-11 21:34:41	pbui	like that was a good stand by the d
2017-11-11 21:34:47	pbui	the offense needs to figure it out
2017-11-11 21:35:32	pbui	qb change!
2017-11-11 21:35:36	pbui	book!
2017-11-11 21:37:32	walter.scheirer	Right before I lost power, the announcer said wimbush looked like he was playing with an injured hand
2017-11-11 21:38:00	pbui	he is
2017-11-11 21:38:20	pbui	doesnt explain all this problems though
2017-11-11 21:38:30	pbui	he's been throwing high and inaccurately all season
2017-11-11 21:38:56	walter.scheirer	Yep
2017-11-11 21:39:15	walter.scheirer	But he was grabbing the snaps with one hand...
2017-11-11 21:39:21	walter.scheirer	That’s no good
2017-11-11 21:39:58	walter.scheirer	Maybe my power will be restored for the second half...
2017-11-11 21:40:04	pbui	good stop
2017-11-11 21:48:44	pbui	game

2017-11-11 21:56:32	walter.scheirer	Wow, Alabama on the verge of losing
2017-11-11 21:56:46	pbui	this would ahve been a good night to win
2017-11-11 21:56:50	pbui	could have been #1
2017-11-11 21:56:58	walter.scheirer	Ohhh... they just scored
2017-11-11 22:12:28	walter.scheirer	Hmm... I may run out of battery soon
2017-11-11 22:13:35	jeffrey	:disappointed:
2017-11-11 22:13:54	pbui	walter.scheirer: probably for the best
2017-11-11 22:14:24	walter.scheirer	Haha
2017-11-11 22:14:30	walter.scheirer	Might as well go to sleep
2017-11-11 22:16:05	walter.scheirer	And the third quarter begins...

2017-11-11 22:18:35	walter.scheirer	The Alabama game still tied...
2017-11-11 22:19:33	jeffrey	It would be nice if we came back and won 37-0
2017-11-11 22:20:00	pbui	this is ur fault jeffrey
2017-11-11 22:20:05	pbui	w/ ur demands

2017-11-11 22:22:15	pbui	it's still a good year
2017-11-11 22:22:19	pbui	we beat usc and msu
2017-11-11 22:22:24	pbui	and hopefully stanford
2017-11-11 22:22:38	jeffrey	all hope is lost
2017-11-11 22:22:45	pbui	ok, be calm
2017-11-11 22:22:48	jeffrey	It's a year without a 37-0
2017-11-11 22:22:52	pbui	we were 4-8 last year
2017-11-11 22:23:21	walter.scheirer	We should get a good bowl game
2017-11-11 22:23:34	walter.scheirer	In spite of this debacle
2017-11-11 22:23:48	pbui	big stop
2017-11-11 22:23:50	pbui	here we go
2017-11-11 22:24:16	pbui	uh

2017-11-11 22:29:54	pbui	alienware commercial
2017-11-11 22:30:54	walter.scheirer	Haha
2017-11-11 22:38:16	jeffrey	37-0, for the wrong team? Oh no

2017-11-12 20:12:46	walter.scheirer	Very kitschy
2017-11-12 20:13:07	walter.scheirer	I think this is the last rotating restaurant in DC

2017-11-12 20:13:28	silv3r	If anything makes me wanna go to grad school it is his weekly escapades to different places
2017-11-12 20:13:48	wtheisen	By rotating you mean the entire restaurant spins right? Or am I misunderstanding this?
2017-11-12 20:19:56	flynn	That doubletree was badly in need of renovationlast time I was there - the power outage notwithstanding, is it in better shape now?
2017-11-12 20:21:53	walter.scheirer	Yeah, it’s pretty nice now
2017-11-12 20:22:06	walter.scheirer	We did face and gesture here in June
2017-11-12 20:22:30	walter.scheirer	I don’t think anybody complained about the venue
2017-11-12 20:22:48	walter.scheirer	@wtheisen: yes
2017-11-12 20:23:00	walter.scheirer	We are slowly rotating
2017-11-12 20:23:06	wtheisen	that is so cool, do you get motion sick?
2017-11-12 20:23:22	walter.scheirer	It’s *very* slow
2017-11-12 20:26:52	flynn	If it goes too fast, people are pressed up against the outer windows and can’t eat :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
2017-11-12 20:27:13	wtheisen	I think I learned about that in physics
2017-11-12 20:28:42	flynn	And the Earth turns ever so slightly in the opposite direction because of that hotel

2017-11-12 21:40:13	pbui	TIL image segmentation involves min-cut
2017-11-12 21:40:35	walter.scheirer	well...
2017-11-12 21:41:01	walter.scheirer	that strategy was popular pre-deep learning
2017-11-12 21:41:08	pbui	right
2017-11-12 21:41:15	pbui	derp learning has changed everything
2017-11-12 21:41:18	pbui	:]
2017-11-12 21:41:35	walter.scheirer	in this case, it did actually improve accuracy
2017-11-12 21:41:50	walter.scheirer	more precisely, a data driven strategy is more useful than graph cuts
2017-11-12 21:44:45	pbui	i ll tell the kids
2017-11-12 21:46:07	walter.scheirer	important
2017-11-12 21:50:46	walter.scheirer	https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/12/us/nsa-shadow-brokers.html 
2017-11-12 21:52:46	walter.scheirer	"Evidence shows that the Shadow Brokers obtained the entire tool kits intact, suggesting that an insider might have simply pocketed a thumb drive and walked out."
2017-11-12 21:53:48	pbui	definitely should give these people a backdoor into our stuff
2017-11-12 22:13:10	wmarkley	@pbui can I️ submit the ethics blog in the morning instead of tonight?
2017-11-12 22:16:55	tbrombac	what do people think about Advanced DBs vs. machine learning
2017-11-12 22:22:18	tweninger	advanced DB is a projects course
2017-11-12 22:22:38	tweninger	you do a project and its a competitions with other groups
2017-11-12 22:23:20	tweninger	machine learning is Dr Chawla's course and I'm not certain about what is taught exactly
2017-11-12 22:31:15	pbui	wmarkley: yeah, that's fnie
2017-11-12 22:31:38	pbui	tbrombac: advanced db is probably more kick back and open ended
2017-11-12 22:34:33	tbrombac	what about the droids and drones class. Im looking for something with coding that will be interesting
2017-11-12 22:36:40	tbrombac	im worried that machine learning will be to high level and not as much implementation.
2017-11-12 22:36:59	pbui	no idea
2017-11-12 22:37:04	pbui	machine learning is evil
2017-11-12 22:37:13	pbui	crosses arms and pouts
2017-11-12 22:38:26	jbaker10	Bui, what classes shud I take?
2017-11-12 22:38:48	jbaker10	I hear systems is good, but i have it on good authority I'm not allowed to take it.
2017-11-12 22:41:53	pbui	jbaker10: fake news
2017-11-12 22:43:05	jbaker10	Well Walter basically told me don't take grad courses...so I'm at a loss
2017-11-12 22:45:30	pbui	do what u said on ur podcast
2017-11-12 22:45:33	pbui	make up your own electives
2017-11-12 22:46:05	jbaker10	I did that. Admins aren't happy about me doing that for all my electives
2017-11-12 22:46:13	jbaker10	I did that 2 times this semester
2017-11-12 23:25:18	pbui	whoa, so if u compute the max flow using ford-fulkerson
2017-11-12 23:25:28	pbui	all u have to do is another traversal and u get the min cut
2017-11-12 23:25:34	pbui	has mind blown
2017-11-12 23:25:52	pbui	i like that i am only learning these things a decade after i took algs..
2017-11-12 23:33:02	jcioffi	woohoo class schedules

2017-11-12 23:42:18	pbui	jcioffi: u are guaranteed i think
2017-11-12 23:42:51	jeffrey	I'll sign up 80 times, so it's just me
2017-11-12 23:43:01	jeffrey	I think I automatically get a credit overload
2017-11-12 23:43:03	pbui	i can live w/ that
2017-11-12 23:43:15	jeffrey	Same for video games
2017-11-12 23:43:19	jeffrey	And all my classes
2017-11-12 23:43:26	catvajiac	jeffrey: save me a spot in video games

2017-11-12 23:43:55	catvajiac	you get a spot, you get a spot, everybody gets a spot!
2017-11-12 23:43:56	jeffrey	I gotta let @ncarroll in too
2017-11-12 23:44:17	ncarroll	wait my name is spelled wrong
2017-11-12 23:44:41	pbui	it's not video games
2017-11-12 23:44:42	ncarroll	ok its better
2017-11-12 23:44:47	pbui	it's history of ocmputing
2017-11-12 23:44:52	jeffrey	Video games
2017-11-12 23:44:53	pbui	and there will be quizzes and an oral exam
2017-11-12 23:44:56	jeffrey	With oral final exam
2017-11-12 23:49:37	pbui	also, i think i made a mistake
2017-11-12 23:49:41	pbui	the class section is too large
2017-11-12 23:49:50	pbui	i should have made the cap 30 seats
2017-11-12 23:50:02	pbui	w/ 50, we will lose the small group intimacy of last year
2017-11-12 23:50:36	jeffrey	Don't worry
2017-11-12 23:50:37	catvajiac	will all 50 fill up tho
2017-11-12 23:50:41	jeffrey	People will stop showing up
2017-11-12 23:50:43	catvajiac	remember people: ORAL FINAL EXAM
2017-11-12 23:50:51	pbui	i hope not
2017-11-12 23:50:53	jeffrey	After the daily quizzes get too hard
2017-11-12 23:50:59	catvajiac	^
2017-11-12 23:51:29	jeffrey	Let a few of us nerdy strut like crazy to make people drop
2017-11-12 23:53:15	jcioffi	wait but i wanna be in the classes too
2017-11-12 23:53:26	jcioffi	i guess ill just have to be a student here forever
2017-11-12 23:55:20	jcioffi	just assign hundred page readings again thatll scare ppl
2017-11-12 23:56:58	ncarroll	but will anyone be able to tell my nerdy strut is facetious ?
2017-11-12 23:57:30	pbui	actually, one thing that is true about the class is that it will be primarily student lead
2017-11-12 23:57:42	pbui	that is there will be a lot of student presentations
2017-11-12 23:58:08	pbui	so if u dont have a passion for games or dont want to share that publicly, the class will be a struggle
2017-11-12 23:58:29	pbui	like, im going to formalize my "hey david can u present something on thursday"
2017-11-12 23:59:04	jcioffi	hm
2017-11-12 23:59:07	jcioffi	_rethinks_

2017-11-13 00:05:54	jeffrey	"no exams"
2017-11-13 00:06:05	jeffrey	or at least, no "Final Exam" attribute

2017-11-13 00:08:15	ncarroll	*solid snake
2017-11-13 00:08:28	jbaker10	That's too advanced for me
2017-11-13 00:08:31	jcioffi	snake is fun
2017-11-13 00:08:43	jbaker10	Actually, can I play type to learn 3?

2017-11-13 00:10:08	pbui	we will probably watch esports one day
2017-11-13 00:10:14	pbui	and have a tourney another day
2017-11-13 00:11:49	jcioffi	oooh

2017-11-13 00:13:58	jeffrey	Can I spend every class fanboying over John Carmack
2017-11-13 00:14:13	jbaker10	Do I have to come to class?
2017-11-13 00:14:47	jbaker10	Actually, I rescind that comment. Instead I demand Age of Empires

2017-11-13 00:15:42	jbaker10	Can I spend the entire semester recreating roller coaster tycoon in x86?

2017-11-13 00:17:14	ncarroll	how is this relevant to the gaming class
2017-11-13 00:17:28	pbui	ncarroll: actually that is a part of the class (the fanboying about a game dev)
2017-11-13 00:17:36	pbui	one of your presentations can be about a favorite dev
2017-11-13 00:17:46	pbui	u just need to talk about something technical as well
2017-11-13 00:18:34	jcioffi	_is intimidated_
2017-11-13 00:21:36	ncarroll	can I talk about how atari developers would alternate the frames where different sprites where drawn to simulate more sprites then were technically possible on the atari?
2017-11-13 00:26:02	pbui	yes, actually that came up last year
2017-11-13 00:26:04	pbui	in hackers

2017-11-13 07:15:51	jeffrey	I should have grabbed a bunch of in-demand classes
2017-11-13 07:15:57	jeffrey	and then sold them later
2017-11-13 07:16:33	jeffrey	Is that ethical, @pbui?
2017-11-13 07:20:09	jeffrey	~halfway through senior darting, and there are 22/40 seats left in video games
2017-11-13 07:20:25	jeffrey	in a surprise turn of events, ethics is now full

2017-11-13 07:21:24	jeffrey	I got my perfect ish schedule, just need to find someone who will do research with me
2017-11-13 07:21:46	jcioffi	oh right research

2017-11-13 07:24:37	jeffrey	LOL, Data Science requires the junior and newer Data Structures, and won't let anyone who took old Data Structures in
2017-11-13 07:24:58	ncarroll	hahaha agism
2017-11-13 07:25:00	wtheisen	@ncarroll bruv you already ditched me last night
2017-11-13 07:25:26	ncarroll	so write down numbers for classes @wtheisen
2017-11-13 07:26:02	jeffrey	We should have to do registration over telephone
2017-11-13 07:27:17	ncarroll	it would be more fun
2017-11-13 07:30:12	jeffrey	I should change my NLP project from something that could maybe be helpful to people to something that detects when it is appropriate to respond "me too thanks"
2017-11-13 07:31:21	dschmied	I'm not particularly smart, and I don't think I do well in a lot of my classes.
2017-11-13 07:31:37	ncarroll	when is that appropriate for a robot to say?
2017-11-13 07:31:43	dschmied	So I'd appreciate it if NOVO would at least GIVE ME CREDIT for the few classes that I ACTUALLY PASSED
2017-11-13 07:31:53	ncarroll	when would a robot say that to a human
2017-11-13 07:32:03	ncarroll	@dschmied lel
2017-11-13 07:32:04	jeffrey	no like, it will be a keyboard program that sends it automatically for a person
2017-11-13 07:32:22	ncarroll	Im wearing my ND snuggie right now
2017-11-13 07:32:51	dschmied	alright I'm going back to sleep. Someone wake me when I don't want to burn Fitz down anymore.
2017-11-13 07:34:05	ncarroll	Ill probably end up with no classes somehow
2017-11-13 07:34:12	jeffrey	is that the alternate title to "Wake Me Up When September Ends"?
2017-11-13 07:34:27	ncarroll	wake me up

2017-11-13 07:42:16	ncarroll	Its like they dont care
2017-11-13 07:46:05	ncarroll	literally if a philo is half full the registration acts like its full
2017-11-13 07:46:24	wtheisen	there's only certain numvers allocated to upper-classmen
2017-11-13 07:46:39	wtheisen	certain number of seats
2017-11-13 07:47:26	jcioffi	the philosophy’s and theology’s tend to have a small number of slots for seniors

2017-11-13 08:59:42	bdevorem	@bdevorem uploaded a file: DOe2vxPWAAE6DjX.jpeg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0HK5M997/F7YPVF66M/doe2vxpwaae6djx.jpeg  and commented: @pbui
2017-11-13 09:30:23	jbaker10	Wait people use Novo? Why would you use that horrific new system when the good old system is still there....
2017-11-13 09:30:57	wtheisen	I actually like NOVO
2017-11-13 09:31:03	wtheisen	what do people have against it?
2017-11-13 09:31:18	jbaker10	Slow
2017-11-13 09:31:23	jbaker10	Is my problem
2017-11-13 09:39:29	jcioffi	@pbui actually?
2017-11-13 10:01:43	walter.scheirer	Wow, reasonable post by Yann
2017-11-13 10:01:50	walter.scheirer	Something new for him
2017-11-13 10:02:05	flynn	lol
2017-11-13 10:03:40	wtheisen	has anyone written gtk apps in c?
2017-11-13 10:03:48	wtheisen	I'm having trouble getting it to work
2017-11-13 10:05:40	pbui	wtheisen: i have in the past, yes
2017-11-13 10:10:07	androidkitkat	theres something other than NOVO?
2017-11-13 10:10:26	pbui	there is this thing called coursicle
2017-11-13 10:10:39	androidkitkat	on inside.nd.edu ?
2017-11-13 10:12:03	jbaker10	i much prefer the old registration system
2017-11-13 10:12:09	jbaker10	And yes it's still available
2017-11-13 10:12:55	jbaker10	Honestly, I'd rather call in from my landline
2017-11-13 10:35:19	androidkitkat	oh boy a linux kernel upgrade
2017-11-13 10:59:05	ewilli23	The registrar is working on a coursicle-esque planning system integrated with novo for next semester
2017-11-13 10:59:39	ewilli23	So like you’ll be able to create schedules ahead of time and then register for all of the classes on your schedule with one click
2017-11-13 11:00:49	ewilli23	TBH someone should write an automated registration script that registers like fantasy auto-drafts: you rank your classes ahead of time and then it just builds a schedule for you based on what’s available
2017-11-13 11:01:10	dchiang	i have a lot of gripes about csrankings.org  but the idea of using it to select subareas, just to see what faculty are active in that area, that's really helpful
2017-11-13 11:01:45	dchiang	and the ranking for a single area seems roughly reasonable
2017-11-13 11:04:40	androidkitkat	thats a good idea @ewilli23
2017-11-13 11:05:45	ewilli23	Of course if everyone autodrafted then everyone would be trying to get seats at the exact same time
2017-11-13 11:05:51	ewilli23	Race conditions galore
2017-11-13 11:08:28	androidkitkat	yeah the only tricky issue would be if more students signed up for the same class than who can enroll
2017-11-13 11:10:01	androidkitkat	based on ID# could maybe be a solution
2017-11-13 11:28:47	jeffrey	how about this
2017-11-13 11:28:50	jeffrey	no classes for anyone
2017-11-13 11:29:21	pbui	hmm, would be cool to bot registration
2017-11-13 11:29:24	pbui	like the airline system
2017-11-13 11:29:30	pbui	looks at southwest
2017-11-13 11:29:41	pbui	REGISTRATION AS A SERVICE
2017-11-13 11:29:46	flynn	RaaS
2017-11-13 11:29:50	jbaker10	what if everyone was registered for every class by default
2017-11-13 11:29:54	jbaker10	then you had to drop them
2017-11-13 11:29:58	flynn	OMG no
2017-11-13 11:30:00	flynn	please
2017-11-13 11:30:24	jbaker10	and if you fail to drop them, you have to take them. Better not forget anything
2017-11-13 11:50:27	ncarroll	I got some more sleep
2017-11-13 11:52:59	ncarroll	can the droid class be exceptionally difficult very early on so only people who are used to getting Cs can take it?
2017-11-13 12:02:58	nbrooks3	lol
2017-11-13 12:15:38	flynn	I would expect the droid class to require a significant amount of very rewarding work :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-11-13 12:21:20	pbui	nbrooks3: video games is open btw
2017-11-13 12:25:12	nbrooks3	I just walked away from my pc to pick up meds
2017-11-13 12:25:16	nbrooks3	Please god
2017-11-13 12:26:46	nbrooks3	Ah
2017-11-13 12:26:48	nbrooks3	Praise the sun
2017-11-13 12:26:56	nbrooks3	Thank you! @pbui
2017-11-13 12:27:10	nbrooks3	Even if there will be some work required, it does look to be pretty interesting
2017-11-13 12:27:45	pbui	I think there will be a few more drops in the coming days
2017-11-13 12:27:47	seiseman	.
2017-11-13 12:28:50	jbaker10	If you don't have a MK tourney it won't be a real class
2017-11-13 12:29:01	jbaker10	MK on N64 no less
2017-11-13 12:32:49	androidkitkat	^
2017-11-13 12:33:39	jbaker10	I will picket
2017-11-13 12:33:56	jeffrey	Mortal Kombat? We did that in Hackers. Or did you mean Mario Kart?
2017-11-13 12:34:10	jbaker10	Mario Kart
2017-11-13 12:34:28	jbaker10	But mortal kombat is also dope
2017-11-13 12:35:49	jeffrey	I do have 2 restored N64 controllers
2017-11-13 12:38:45	jeffrey	Should I reply to Thain's email containing today's lecture with "unsubscribe"?
2017-11-13 12:40:30	androidkitkat	I have an N64 and two OG controllers
2017-11-13 12:40:41	androidkitkat	I want to buy an everdrive for it
2017-11-13 12:41:17	jeffrey	Why not make one
2017-11-13 12:41:34	ncarroll	@flynn I want the work to be so significant that others will drop it so I can take it
2017-11-13 12:41:45	androidkitkat	@jeffrey wouldnt an everdrive be hard to make
2017-11-13 12:42:15	androidkitkat	if i could do it with a raspi i would
2017-11-13 12:42:41	jeffrey	I don't think a pi has enough/fast enough io
2017-11-13 12:42:53	jeffrey	But most fpgas definitely do
2017-11-13 12:43:01	jeffrey	Since that's what the everdrive uses...
2017-11-13 12:43:52	androidkitkat	or spend $100 to get an everdrive new
2017-11-13 12:44:12	jeffrey	But personally I wouldn't invest $100 in something for a system that will eventually die
2017-11-13 12:44:28	androidkitkat	everything dies
2017-11-13 12:44:31	jeffrey	I bought two of those USB adapters
2017-11-13 12:44:45	androidkitkat	eventually x86_64 will die
2017-11-13 12:45:15	jeffrey	Yeah but there are ARM n64 emulators too
2017-11-13 12:45:48	jeffrey	And it's pretty easy to make an n64 to usb adapter, the protocol is pretty straightforward
2017-11-13 12:46:02	androidkitkat	but but my original hardware
2017-11-13 12:47:29	jeffrey	Original controllers > original console
2017-11-13 12:47:39	androidkitkat	the only thing i might do is if i can get my Wii to play GameCube games from file, ill just homebrew
2017-11-13 12:48:04	androidkitkat	homebrewed wii wouldnt be bad
2017-11-13 12:48:16	jeffrey	Homebrewed wiis are dope
2017-11-13 12:48:40	androidkitkat	i also really need more gamecube memory cards
2017-11-13 12:51:32	nbrooks3	I think I have a gamecube mem card lying somewhere
2017-11-13 12:52:34	jeffrey	I should have some at home
2017-11-13 12:53:00	ncarroll	I want to revitalize an orphaned open source emulator project
2017-11-13 12:53:13	ncarroll	#orphansource
2017-11-13 12:54:20	androidkitkat	orphan source?
2017-11-13 12:56:50	ncarroll	deep lug lore.  its on the bag of Lug shirt. involving past members and a series of unfortunate events
2017-11-13 12:57:09	wtheisen	@ncarroll you weren’t even there
2017-11-13 12:57:36	ncarroll	I know
2017-11-13 12:57:39	androidkitkat	It isnt a story the root users would tell you
2017-11-13 12:57:46	ncarroll	Im still trying to explain it to help though
2017-11-13 13:00:34	androidkitkat	Did you ever hear the tragedy of Orphan Source software? I thought not. It’s not a story root users would tell you. It’s an ARCH legend. Orphan Source was a Dark Lord of Linux, so powerful and so wise he could use sudo to influence the file permissions to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from being deleted. The dark side of Linux is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. Orphan Source became so powerful… the only thing it was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
2017-11-13 13:00:39	androidkitkat	the meme died halfway through
2017-11-13 13:02:35	pbui	slow claps
2017-11-13 13:02:44	androidkitkat	i changed some words
2017-11-13 13:02:59	androidkitkat	With more effort, it would get there
2017-11-13 13:03:21	pbui	Kill -9
2017-11-13 13:04:09	androidkitkat	!g Kill -9

2017-11-13 13:04:27	androidkitkat	you trying to kill something
2017-11-13 13:14:21	pbui	@jeffrey: can u bring the hd to my office this afternoon?
2017-11-13 13:14:39	jeffrey	Ye when
2017-11-13 13:15:02	pbui	whenever
2017-11-13 13:15:04	pbui	im here until 5pm
2017-11-13 13:35:25	jeffrey	Which class do I rant about how video games should be open source and video game developers don't deserve compensation for their work in? Ethics or PPFC?
2017-11-13 13:35:53	pbui	i prefer HoC than PPFC
2017-11-13 13:36:19	pbui	AFS getting updates? https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=AFS-Overhauled-Linux-4.15 https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=AFS-Overhauled-Linux-4.15 
2017-11-13 13:36:23	pbui	better send to MD
2017-11-13 13:37:43	jeffrey	Tell MD that he made them not give me my pin and so I'm mad at him
2017-11-13 13:37:56	jeffrey	But also you didn't answer my question
2017-11-13 13:40:06	pbui	jeffrey: y not both
2017-11-13 13:45:21	walter.scheirer	Conferences with 30,000 attendees are exhausting...
2017-11-13 13:47:22	jeffrey	Won't people get tired of me going full RMS?
2017-11-13 13:47:39	pbui	maybe
2017-11-13 13:50:00	flynn	gotta give rms credit for being consistent in his convictions
2017-11-13 13:50:34	pbui	https://www.reddit.com/r/StallmanWasRight/ 
2017-11-13 13:51:41	wtheisen	@wtheisen uploaded a file: Image uploaded from iOS https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0KQYK7DK/F7ZL3NLJ1/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg 
2017-11-13 13:51:57	jeffrey	Last year in Hackers I was like, he's full of it, it's not that big of a deal.
2017-11-13 13:52:27	jeffrey	This year I'm like "this game isn't open source, and doesn't run on Linux, idk if I can support that."
2017-11-13 13:53:52	pbui	wtheisen: :ok_hand:
2017-11-13 13:54:02	8bit	Could we ever invite RMS to give a talk at ND?
2017-11-13 13:56:17	flynn	We seriously considered it a few years ago
2017-11-13 13:56:40	flynn	rustles around my email archive
2017-11-13 13:57:17	flynn	Aah, yes. https://secure.mysociety.org/admin/lists/pipermail/developers-public/2011-October/007647.html 
2017-11-13 13:58:10	flynn	My quote at the time: "This is worse than the no-brown-M&M rider on Van Halen's venue contracts."
2017-11-13 13:59:25	8bit	lol, he does have a very interesting packet on his hosting situation...
2017-11-13 13:59:31	8bit	Would it ever be considered again?
2017-11-13 13:59:54	flynn	Actually, looking back through email, FSF wondered if we could invite him to ND since he was going to be at Illinois at the time...
2017-11-13 14:04:06	jeffrey	I remember that coke boycott. It was in the first observer article I ever read
2017-11-13 14:06:25	wtheisen	man compilers(arrays) just gets trickier and trickier the closer I get
2017-11-13 14:16:50	jeffrey	it would be nice if he answered by piazza posts
2017-11-13 14:17:03	jeffrey	maybe he's mad at me for unsubscribing
2017-11-13 14:30:11	jeffrey	Where you at with those arrays @wtheisen?
2017-11-13 14:30:38	wtheisen	I'm trying to get it to check subtypes when assigning multi-dimensional arrays
2017-11-13 14:30:54	wtheisen	so like in good10, if one was string and the other int it needs to fail
2017-11-13 14:31:00	wtheisen	but I keep seg-faulting
2017-11-13 14:31:59	jeffrey	you dereferencing subtype on a null pointer maybe?
2017-11-13 14:32:16	wtheisen	yeah that's why, I just can't figure out why it's null
2017-11-13 14:36:46	wtheisen	welp figured that bit out, the name is NULL when I lookup, now to hunt that down
2017-11-13 14:54:11	wtheisen	why would e->left->name be null but e->right->name not be?
2017-11-13 14:54:26	jeffrey	Did you do negatives that way?
2017-11-13 14:54:55	jeffrey	Or have it index by a variable?
2017-11-13 14:55:06	jeffrey	The left for arrays might not be a name if they're 2d
2017-11-13 14:55:24	wtheisen	how would I access that then?
2017-11-13 14:55:30	wtheisen	e->left->left?
2017-11-13 14:55:39	jeffrey	What are you trying to access?
2017-11-13 14:55:54	wtheisen	yes
2017-11-13 14:55:56	wtheisen	hell yes
2017-11-13 14:55:58	wtheisen	that was it
2017-11-13 14:56:04	wtheisen	I love you @jeffrey
2017-11-13 14:56:28	wtheisen	also I'm dumb but anyway
2017-11-13 15:27:29	wtheisen	alright 1 more case to go
2017-11-13 16:04:07	jeffrey	is submitting a meme for algs a bad idea?
2017-11-13 16:04:49	wtheisen	man what a tough assignment, @jeffrey chen seems like a man to appreciate dank memes
2017-11-13 16:05:35	jeffrey	For #2 where we gotta argue, I put the "look at this graph" nickleback vine
2017-11-13 16:08:51	wtheisen	I mean the TAs are the ones that grade it anyway
2017-11-13 16:08:56	jeffrey	i know
2017-11-13 16:09:04	jeffrey	but what if they go "-5 unprofessional"
2017-11-13 16:09:30	wtheisen	just depends on whether you get @mburke18 or not
2017-11-13 16:09:54	jeffrey	also sidenote are we ever getting back hw5?
2017-11-13 16:11:53	dschmied	Ask them if they agree/understand under the graph.
2017-11-13 16:12:03	dschmied	That’s what I did.
2017-11-13 16:12:17	jeffrey	lol
2017-11-13 16:13:54	nbrooks3	Clear as the South Bend skies, Professor Chen.
2017-11-13 16:15:52	dschmied	I’m gonna go change it to say is it clear right now actually.
2017-11-13 16:15:59	dschmied	Makes more sense
2017-11-13 16:31:05	jeffrey	why is it so hard for people to write "quiet" instead of "quite"
2017-11-13 16:31:17	jeffrey	google has "She led a quite life" for Arrows
2017-11-13 16:32:07	jeffrey	My little brother had to do a project where he had to write his personality traits. He wrote "I am quite", and when my family hung it up my dad wrote "annoying" after "quite".
2017-11-13 17:03:05	dchiang	I like this quote from the RMS post: "I have to spend 6 to 8 hours *every day* doing my usual work"
2017-11-13 17:04:41	walter.scheirer	Which he concedes is just email
2017-11-13 17:05:06	walter.scheirer	I don’t think RMS has done any work in decades
2017-11-13 17:56:47	androidkitkat	@ssjohns is it true that negative scores on comments can only impact you -199
2017-11-13 17:56:49	androidkitkat	-100
2017-11-13 17:59:31	pbui	jcioffi: we should have a google doc so people can write what they are bringing
2017-11-13 17:59:36	pbui	that way we dont get 4 veggie trays
2017-11-13 18:03:28	ssjohns	@androidkitkat https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?context=3 
2017-11-13 18:03:43	androidkitkat	that one
2017-11-13 18:03:47	ssjohns	This should help you figure it out.
2017-11-13 18:03:52	androidkitkat	they still have positive comment karma
2017-11-13 18:03:56	ssjohns	Yes
2017-11-13 18:04:13	androidkitkat	rip
2017-11-13 18:04:24	ssjohns	I think originally trolls used negative karma as a badge of honor so there was a cap placed on it.
2017-11-13 18:04:59	androidkitkat	and how many downvotes would they need to get for the score to wrap around
2017-11-13 18:05:06	androidkitkat	-2bil?
2017-11-13 18:05:30	ssjohns	It won't wrap around.
2017-11-13 18:05:35	androidkitkat	rip again
2017-11-13 18:05:46	ssjohns	Why rip?
2017-11-13 18:06:14	androidkitkat	itd be hilarious if we could get 2 billion people to interact with a comment so much as for it to become the most popular comment on reddit
2017-11-13 18:07:17	androidkitkat	do comments like this get brought up in the office?
2017-11-13 18:07:21	pbui	https://www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/545738/ 
2017-11-13 18:14:36	jeffrey	So you store comment karma as a variable length integer? Why?
2017-11-13 18:15:10	flynn	Because of conversations like this, maybe?
2017-11-13 18:16:28	jeffrey	But like, it's still really far from -4B, or -2^63, or other common sizes
2017-11-13 18:16:51	androidkitkat	but imagine the raise reddit employees would get if over 2 billion people all interacted with one thing
2017-11-13 18:17:11	jeffrey	Make it a long
2017-11-13 18:17:30	jeffrey	It goes higher than the sustainable population of earth
2017-11-13 18:18:00	androidkitkat	we need to make moon colonies then
2017-11-13 18:18:03	flynn	signed long long… just in case
2017-11-13 18:18:55	androidkitkat	lets populate mars so we can get lots of people interacting with a reddit comment
2017-11-13 18:19:04	androidkitkat	within 6 months
2017-11-13 18:19:10	androidkitkat	so it doesnt get archived
2017-11-13 18:20:53	ssjohns	Yeah we bring up this stuff in the office. It's funny because EA is frantically buying gold to try and save the situation and it isn't working.
2017-11-13 18:21:26	ssjohns	Their PR department are also really shitty people so we don't really work with them on looking good.
2017-11-13 18:22:09	jeffrey	I just want their investors to drop them and for the NFL, FIFA, and Disney to say "meh, someone else can make our games."
2017-11-13 18:22:16	androidkitkat	`wait EA IS BUYING THE GOLD
2017-11-13 18:22:37	androidkitkat	thats hilarious
2017-11-13 18:23:36	ssjohns	That is unconfirmed, but that's what it looks like.
2017-11-13 18:24:24	androidkitkat	nice ambiguity right there
2017-11-13 18:24:44	androidkitkat	theyve got gold over 40 times just take make their comment still appear
2017-11-13 18:24:57	androidkitkat	if anything that hurts them bc reddit will hivemind and downvote more
2017-11-13 18:27:27	ssjohns	Haha, last thing I need is an article with quotes from me about this. > The infamous shaqhacks, Reddit employee, confirms that EA is buying gold to stay relevant.
2017-11-13 18:27:39	ssjohns	> Update: Former Reddit employee.
2017-11-13 18:27:54	androidkitkat	haha
2017-11-13 18:29:41	silv3r	Wait that is actually hilarious
2017-11-13 18:29:46	silv3r	45 gold
2017-11-13 18:30:12	silv3r	Approaching -500,000
2017-11-13 18:31:24	androidkitkat	Ik
2017-11-13 18:31:45	androidkitkat	a reddit employee should accidently make it 0
2017-11-13 18:32:02	androidkitkat	for the lols
2017-11-13 18:33:05	wtheisen	welp time to pretend I know what algs is
2017-11-13 18:37:28	silv3r	They should make it -1M @androidkitkat
2017-11-13 18:40:47	ssjohns	I don't think that's possible. At least not easily. We'd have to somehow change every vote individually and make 750 million accounts to vote on that.
2017-11-13 18:40:59	ssjohns	It wasn't made to be easy to break, I don't think.
2017-11-13 18:40:59	wtheisen	call up russia
2017-11-13 18:41:07	ssjohns	Lol.
2017-11-13 19:06:05	androidkitkat	Sounds like a simple python script
2017-11-13 20:23:39	jeffrey	I'd like to think that the reason question 2 on algs is "is john right or not" is because they're behind on grading and wanted to crowd source it.
2017-11-13 20:26:23	pbui	so...
2017-11-13 20:26:33	pbui	im gonna show the OS kids how to make linux kernel modules tomorrow
2017-11-13 20:26:41	jeffrey	nice
2017-11-13 20:26:42	pbui	i just made a device driver that returns song lyrics
2017-11-13 20:26:44	pbui	lol
2017-11-13 20:27:07	jeffrey	tell x to use it as your mouse
2017-11-13 20:28:42	pbui	only problem is that it segfaults when i try to rmmod it
2017-11-13 20:28:47	pbui	and the kernel goes oops...
2017-11-13 20:28:49	pbui	oh well

2017-11-13 20:31:32	jeffrey	uh, worth trying on win10? think something bad'll happen?
2017-11-13 20:34:31	jeffrey	oh i need the kernel source dont i
2017-11-13 20:35:04	jeffrey	or at least some headers?

2017-11-13 21:07:27	pbui	im likely to bork my laptop in front of the class
2017-11-13 21:07:37	androidkitkat	what r u doing tomorrow
2017-11-13 21:07:42	pbui	thursday should be better when i RAID 0, 1, and 5 my RPI

2017-11-13 21:32:20	androidkitkat	please dont disrespect SATA
2017-11-13 21:32:30	androidkitkat	if anything, disrespect PATA
2017-11-13 21:32:40	jeffrey	how are you SATAing a raspberry pi
2017-11-13 21:32:50	pbui	ssd -> 8k IOPs, sata hd -> 80 IOPs
2017-11-13 21:32:57	pbui	im comparing my laptop to my desktop
2017-11-13 21:33:06	pbui	laptop as ssd, while desktop has sata hd
2017-11-13 21:33:15	jeffrey	is the ssd not SATA?
2017-11-13 21:33:16	androidkitkat	laptop is nvme or pcie
2017-11-13 21:33:19	androidkitkat	or sata
2017-11-13 21:33:20	jeffrey	is it NVMe?
2017-11-13 21:33:29	pbui	i think it's sata
2017-11-13 21:33:35	androidkitkat	@pbui what sata version is ur desktop
2017-11-13 21:33:41	pbui	dunno
2017-11-13 21:33:47	jeffrey	so what do you mean sata is bad for iops
2017-11-13 21:33:54	androidkitkat	what board do you have
2017-11-13 21:33:55	pbui	ATA controller: Intel Corporation 8 Series/C220 Series Chipset Family 6-port SATA Controller 1 [AHCI mode] (rev 04)
2017-11-13 21:34:06	pbui	i mean sata hard disks (spinning platters)
2017-11-13 21:34:15	pbui	i call hard disks sata
2017-11-13 21:34:18	pbui	out of habit
2017-11-13 21:34:30	jeffrey	but i handed you a PATA hd today
2017-11-13 21:34:42	jeffrey	don't you dare call it sata in class
2017-11-13 21:34:44	androidkitkat	@jeffrey why do you have a pata drive at school
2017-11-13 21:34:48	pbui	i ll call it IDE
2017-11-13 21:35:00	jeffrey	fine
2017-11-13 21:35:08	jeffrey	And I stole it from @pbui @androidkitkat
2017-11-13 21:35:09	androidkitkat	If you are talking about IDE interfaces
2017-11-13 21:35:14	androidkitkat	I need to go to that class
2017-11-13 21:36:47	jeffrey	if you wanna kill an SSD in ~10 months, run windows xp on it through an IDE->SATA adapter
2017-11-13 21:37:14	walter.scheirer	uh huh
2017-11-13 21:37:23	androidkitkat	they make IDE SSDs
2017-11-13 21:37:40	jeffrey	... does IDE support TRIM?
2017-11-13 21:37:47	androidkitkat	I doubt it
2017-11-13 21:37:56	androidkitkat	!g does PATA support TRIM
2017-11-13 21:37:57	jeffrey	so how will the ssd not just die in a year?

2017-11-14 15:07:55	jcioffi	@pbui do you think that programming is something people can or cannot do? like that there are people that can never grasp it even if they try? excluding those that don’t have the desire to learn
2017-11-14 15:16:52	pbui	I think this is something we ll discuss on the podcast
2017-11-14 15:18:27	pbui	I think anyone can learn to program, at least the fundamentals
2017-11-14 15:19:13	pbui	I don't think people are born with a geek Gene or that only certain people can do it
2017-11-14 15:19:44	pbui	That said I think that some people will excel at it more than others
2017-11-14 15:19:56	walter.scheirer	Maybe evolution is moving very fast!
2017-11-14 15:20:28	pbui	Just like I can learn to play basketball and I love it but I'm not very good at it

2017-11-14 15:21:54	walter.scheirer	But seriously, there are no genes for complex learned behaviors
2017-11-14 15:22:57	pbui	Everyone can learn to read and write
2017-11-14 15:23:04	walter.scheirer	Not true
2017-11-14 15:23:18	walter.scheirer	Some people have serious cognitive deficits
2017-11-14 15:23:18	pbui	Not everyone will be avid readers or become authors

2017-11-14 15:30:01	walter.scheirer	Maybe we could use some wild types...
2017-11-14 15:31:01	walter.scheirer	I’m proud to report that most of our brain reconstruction work was done under Linux
2017-11-14 15:31:35	walter.scheirer	And the code will be open sourced soon
2017-11-14 15:36:55	pbui	Sounds like lug material
2017-11-14 15:38:27	androidkitkat	i love it when i remember commands for the terminal that do something that i wouldnormally have to google
2017-11-14 15:39:59	walter.scheirer	I should do a lug talk titled “reconstructing brains for fun and profit”

2017-11-14 18:20:21	wtheisen	you have to do it manually
2017-11-14 18:20:32	wtheisen	@pbui knows how
2017-11-14 18:21:00	androidkitkat	:raised_hands:
2017-11-14 18:21:16	androidkitkat	if i can use the built in VPN thing i would be pleased

2017-11-14 19:12:42	alitteke	Can I design the lug shirt\
2017-11-14 19:13:26	ccarball	alitteke: yes!!!
2017-11-14 19:13:29	jcioffi	sure @alitteke
2017-11-14 19:13:58	jcioffi	i think shirt is good call - we can discuss if other apparel is wanted at meeting Wednesday?
2017-11-14 19:32:17	pbui	@androidkitkat: u should use openconnect
2017-11-14 19:32:26	pbui	i think there is a networkmanager extension

2017-11-14 22:26:27	wmarkley	Are there any popular kernels that are not written in C? Just curious

2017-11-14 22:33:12	wmarkley	Looks cool. I’ll have to check it out
2017-11-14 23:07:05	androidkitkat	@wtheisen you run TLP right
2017-11-14 23:18:17	wmarkley	@pbui are you still planning to teach your OS class how to write a Linux device driver?
2017-11-14 23:41:03	pbui	technically a loadable kernel module
2017-11-14 23:41:05	pbui	on thursday
2017-11-15 00:13:08	wmarkley	Ok I may sit in on your class then.
2017-11-15 00:13:29	wmarkley	That stuff is very interesting to me and I haven’t had the chance to learn about it
2017-11-15 00:46:09	jeffrey	The next 10 minutes will be very scary.

2017-11-15 00:47:45	8bit	jeffrey: I am super excited about this
2017-11-15 00:47:54	8bit	best of luck on the next ten mins
2017-11-15 00:48:26	jeffrey	It /is/ writing the firmware
2017-11-15 00:48:40	jeffrey	Hopefully what it is writing is, you know, good
2017-11-15 00:49:11	jeffrey	It's verifying...
2017-11-15 02:03:06	ewilli23	@jcioffi YES we need CSE apparel
2017-11-15 02:07:42	jcioffi	any clue how to get on this?
2017-11-15 02:07:52	jcioffi	there's enough faculty in the chat, maybe they will have an idea
2017-11-15 02:09:57	ssjohns	Hey I'm trying to take my coworkers to a tailgate on Saturday. Does anyone know of any I can bring them to?
2017-11-15 02:21:38	jeffrey	no
2017-11-15 02:29:11	bobbit	From "NDLUG Blog" feed: John Effrey - Intel Management Engine by Unknown @ https://yld.me/xsQ 
2017-11-15 07:22:03	flynn	*perk*
2017-11-15 07:22:43	flynn	@jcioffi I think the place to start is with SAO - figure out their rules, if any, for apparel and tchotchke sales
2017-11-15 07:23:20	flynn	It might also be a good idea to talk to the NDSeed officers to see how they do it (they've had a gangbuster apparel sale for years)
2017-11-15 07:24:13	flynn	Of course you need to not come across as competition, so maybe plan a spring sale, well after their sale is over :neutral_face:
2017-11-15 07:25:28	flynn	But the most important advice is to start small and scale up.  It's fine for the first year's stock to be a single item and not a large supply. They will be instant collector's items and should build buzz for next year.
2017-11-15 07:37:16	flynn	Also: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tchotchke 
2017-11-15 07:56:10	8bit	Huh.  I've heard the word, but if asked to spell it, I would have given a radically different and wrong answer.
2017-11-15 08:04:39	wtheisen	@ssjohns i’ll find you one
2017-11-15 08:05:48	wtheisen	@androidkitkat yeah i️ do
2017-11-15 08:06:05	wtheisen	@wmarkley sit in the back with me dude
2017-11-15 08:06:40	androidkitkat	Does your laptop.ever reboot after coming out of suspend
2017-11-15 08:06:56	wtheisen	ahhhh no.
2017-11-15 08:07:08	wtheisen	that sounds like a problem
2017-11-15 08:08:50	androidkitkat	I may have fixed it
2017-11-15 08:09:07	androidkitkat	Byt it seems like a very dumb fix
2017-11-15 08:09:19	8bit	What is the fix?
2017-11-15 08:09:42	androidkitkat	I uncommented a line that changed suspend behavior
2017-11-15 08:09:50	androidkitkat	Reboot. And then comment that line again
2017-11-15 08:09:52	androidkitkat	And it works
2017-11-15 09:05:20	ewilli23	Any chance any of the cse electives will get seats added? Particularly @walter.scheirer and @tweninger
2017-11-15 09:09:44	tweninger	For you - yes
2017-11-15 09:10:00	tweninger	I have 7 seats reserved email me
2017-11-15 09:10:44	tweninger	I have one spot left in the waiting I think p
2017-11-15 09:11:28	tweninger	I have one spot left in the waiting list I think that guarantees youll get in
2017-11-15 09:14:07	ewilli23	Amen thank you
2017-11-15 09:14:16	ewilli23	Just sent you an email
2017-11-15 09:15:53	walter.scheirer	Is security out of seats?
2017-11-15 09:16:19	walter.scheirer	I’m traveling, but can address that later today when I get back
2017-11-15 09:18:02	ewilli23	Yes please thank you
2017-11-15 09:18:56	wtheisen	@ssjohns there’s a tailgate with a bunch of Duncan CS guys if you’re interested
2017-11-15 09:25:18	ewilli23	@walter.scheirer should I email you as well
2017-11-15 09:47:57	walter.scheirer	Please — that way I will remember after I land
2017-11-15 09:59:45	jcioffi	always traveling
2017-11-15 10:00:14	dchiang	anyone have a voltmeter i can borrow?
2017-11-15 10:00:51	dchiang	did juniors finish darting?
2017-11-15 10:01:21	jcioffi	no to the voltometer, and i believe they are done
2017-11-15 10:01:29	jcioffi	*voltmeter
2017-11-15 10:01:29	ewilli23	“Finish” is perhaps a strong word
2017-11-15 10:03:25	flynn	@dchiang I have a voltmeter - will be back in my office at 11:00 or so.
2017-11-15 10:04:45	dchiang	thanks!
2017-11-15 11:25:46	jbaker10	Why do you need a voltmeter...?
2017-11-15 11:31:14	jeffrey	to measure voltage, duh
2017-11-15 12:40:17	dchiang	Furnace humidifier is not working
2017-11-15 13:01:13	flynn	I put the voltmeter in your mailbox in the CSE office.
2017-11-15 13:01:23	flynn	Don't measure the voltage twice, though.
2017-11-15 13:01:34	flynn	Because that would be revolting
2017-11-15 13:51:20	jeffrey	That was the second worst joke I've ever heard.
2017-11-15 13:51:26	jeffrey	err, read
2017-11-15 13:54:25	flynn	high fives himself... go me
2017-11-15 13:55:36	ssjohns	@wtheisen That actually sounds awesome. I'll be bringing one of my co-workers so it'll be great to meet more CS undergrads lol.
2017-11-15 13:59:28	ssjohns	@flynn I think it was a great joke. Saving it for the future haha.
2017-11-15 14:35:35	ewilli23	Hang on the description for Biometrics says they use Matlab
2017-11-15 14:36:06	ewilli23	I didn’t think anyone in this department used Matlab
2017-11-15 14:39:01	jeffrey	Prof Czajka does for NN and Biometrics
2017-11-15 14:45:27	ssjohns	Matlab is easy setup and better than some more confusing alternatives, it's gui interface helps get rid of a lot of confusion in programming. Actually we use Matlab here at Reddit and it's common in industry to find data science done with Matlab.
2017-11-15 14:46:02	ssjohns	(These are all lies and sarcasm, Matlab is the fifth horseman of the apocalypse.)
2017-11-15 14:48:20	jeffrey	hey, three aren't given names, matlab can very well be pestilence, war, or famine
2017-11-15 14:51:07	ssjohns	Pestilence maybe? It is riddles with bugs and feels like a plague.
2017-11-15 15:16:40	jeffrey	+1

2017-11-15 19:08:44	pbui	someone should bring turkish delights
2017-11-15 19:09:00	pbui	u know, narnia style
2017-11-15 19:09:07	jcioffi	we already have baklava
2017-11-15 19:09:14	pbui	not the same
2017-11-15 19:09:17	jcioffi	that’s Turkish
2017-11-15 19:09:26	pbui	NOT THE SAME
2017-11-15 19:09:36	pbui	it's like saying romanians are russians
2017-11-15 19:09:39	pbui	that's just wrong
2017-11-15 19:09:47	jcioffi	wow
2017-11-15 19:09:51	jcioffi	wow wow
2017-11-15 19:10:04	jeffrey	no he's right
2017-11-15 19:10:21	jeffrey	Even though turkish delight is awful
2017-11-15 19:10:31	pbui	yeah, it usually is
2017-11-15 19:10:36	pbui	i had some good stuff in san fran though

2017-11-15 19:13:39	catvajiac	:]
2017-11-15 19:13:48	pbui	after your comp defense
2017-11-15 19:13:59	pbui	i ll have to abandon that position
2017-11-15 19:14:02	pbui	u are french now
2017-11-15 19:14:09	catvajiac	omg
2017-11-15 19:14:14	catvajiac	i guess thats better?
2017-11-15 19:14:18	catvajiac	at least i know like 2% french
2017-11-15 20:34:06	ewilli23	Serious question: what is the point of C++’s pass-by-reference mechanic? Why not just pass a pointer? It’s much more transparent.
2017-11-15 20:34:47	pbui	u are not wrong
2017-11-15 20:34:59	pbui	it's syntatic sugar that confuses people
2017-11-15 20:37:01	walter.scheirer	like many of the other features of that fine language
2017-11-15 20:47:32	jeffrey	Pointers are dangerous. References can't be nothing.
2017-11-15 21:08:17	ewilli23	True, but when you call the function in C++ you can’t tell if it’s passed by value or by reference.
2017-11-15 21:09:33	jeffrey	which is the worst thing about the language
2017-11-15 21:09:40	jeffrey	beating out this garbage:
2017-11-15 21:09:56	jeffrey	`container.back() = 5;`
2017-11-15 21:10:36	pbui	i hate that u have to pop after u do front/top
2017-11-15 21:10:38	pbui	ugh
2017-11-15 21:10:47	jeffrey	yeah
2017-11-15 21:11:00	jeffrey	I was writing python and was like "does pop actually return anything?"
2017-11-15 21:11:21	jeffrey	but that's not the language
2017-11-15 21:12:26	ewilli23	I think passing by reference would be fine if you had to pass the argument as `&argument`
2017-11-15 21:12:51	ewilli23	I do that anyway because that seems like how it should be and then I get all sorts of compiler errors
2017-11-15 21:12:56	ewilli23	And then I get upset
2017-11-15 21:13:12	jeffrey	but how do you separate a reference from a pointer?
2017-11-15 21:13:37	ewilli23	I mean is there any practical difference, from the caller perspective?
2017-11-15 21:13:53	jeffrey	Potentially
2017-11-15 21:14:40	jeffrey	Especially if, for some reason, you have a function that is templated, and takes in a reference
2017-11-15 21:14:58	jeffrey	Unless you can't do that
2017-11-15 21:15:05	pbui	there are differences
2017-11-15 21:15:27	pbui	like for OS project 05, i had to resort to passing things by pointers, b/c passing by reference lead to all these weird c++ rules
2017-11-15 21:15:31	pbui	about copying and moving
2017-11-15 21:15:38	pbui	which i dont have time to deal w/
2017-11-15 21:15:44	pbui	so i just used a pointer
2017-11-15 21:16:46	ewilli23	But did those affect the calling function?
2017-11-15 21:17:09	jeffrey	fun fact - no passing pointer expression into templated reference
2017-11-15 21:18:56	pbui	what do u mean ewilli23
2017-11-15 21:19:23	pbui	i had to explicitly use pointers
2017-11-15 21:19:44	dchiang	References can't change, which might make them easier to reason about?
2017-11-15 21:19:58	jeffrey	But that makes them less powerful.
2017-11-15 21:20:01	dchiang	And you can't do pointer arithmetic on them
2017-11-15 21:20:10	dchiang	Yes, less powerful is often more good
2017-11-15 21:20:14	pbui	less is more
2017-11-15 21:20:21	wtheisen	features are faults
2017-11-15 21:20:28	jeffrey	But like, C++ just seems like a weird middle ground
2017-11-15 21:20:35	wtheisen	well that's just c++
2017-11-15 21:20:40	jeffrey	Like, why not use Python or Java
2017-11-15 21:20:49	wtheisen	compiling to c
2017-11-15 21:20:49	jeffrey	or if you want to do dangerous things sometimes, C
2017-11-15 21:21:06	ewilli23	@pbui did you have to write the calling function differently or just write the called function as taking a pointer
2017-11-15 21:21:09	dchiang	Pascal has them too, sort of
2017-11-15 21:21:47	pbui	ewilli23: i had to use ->
2017-11-15 21:21:50	pbui	internally
2017-11-15 21:21:52	pbui	so yes
2017-11-15 21:21:57	dchiang	I think everyone can agree that the syntax is stupid
2017-11-15 21:21:59	pbui	c++ has grown on me a lot
2017-11-15 21:22:03	jeffrey	I'm fine with references, but C++ has too many ways of representing "that thing over there"
2017-11-15 21:22:04	pbui	the next os project is all in c++
2017-11-15 21:22:13	pbui	but that said, i find it a frustrating language
2017-11-15 21:22:19	pbui	b/c it has potential and it falls so short
2017-11-15 21:22:30	pbui	like look up how u do random numbers in c++
2017-11-15 21:22:33	jeffrey	References, raw pointers, shared/unique/weak pointers
2017-11-15 21:22:38	pbui	u have to declare 2/3 different things
2017-11-15 21:22:46	pbui	rather than just use rand()
2017-11-15 21:22:52	dchiang	It really feels like there is a good language in there trying to escape, right?
2017-11-15 21:23:05	pbui	like the "c++ way" is just so cumbersome sometimes
2017-11-15 21:23:25	jeffrey	More recent c++ is getting more bearable
2017-11-15 21:23:29	dchiang	Disagree about unique/shared/weak -- I think that makes a lot of sense
2017-11-15 21:23:32	pbui	then again, when u can use the STL and the library, it can make for great code that is mostly readable and high performance
2017-11-15 21:24:01	pbui	i think i like it more than i hate it, but it is trying
2017-11-15 21:24:20	jeffrey	I wouldn't get rid of shared/unique/weak
2017-11-15 21:24:27	jeffrey	but I would move references into that
2017-11-15 21:26:02	jeffrey	Like, I guess my complaint with having a lot of pointer like things is that it's not very pythonic
2017-11-15 21:26:13	jeffrey	Especially since you have three different syntaxes
2017-11-15 21:26:31	jeffrey	I would deprecate * and &
2017-11-15 21:27:30	jeffrey	Then there is one syntax
2017-11-15 21:28:20	ewilli23	What syntax is left
2017-11-15 21:28:36	jeffrey	smart pointers
2017-11-15 21:28:48	ewilli23	What are smart pointers
2017-11-15 21:29:07	jeffrey	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_pointer 
2017-11-15 21:29:09	pbui	didnt u go over them in ds?
2017-11-15 21:29:18	pbui	they basically do reference counting for u
2017-11-15 21:29:26	pbui	and will free the resources
2017-11-15 21:29:26	ewilli23	Don’t think so
2017-11-15 21:29:28	ewilli23	But maybe
2017-11-15 21:29:33	ewilli23	I didn’t go to very many lectures
2017-11-15 21:29:36	pbui	well, u didnt remember du
2017-11-15 21:29:38	pbui	so...
2017-11-15 21:29:40	pbui	:]
2017-11-15 21:29:47	pbui	be sure to come to OS tomorrow
2017-11-15 21:29:51	pbui	so u can demonstrate du
2017-11-15 21:30:03	pbui	we be formatting some usb sticks
2017-11-15 21:30:14	dchiang	here's another way of thinking about references instead of "another kind of pointer"
2017-11-15 21:30:21	dchiang	in both C and C++, all variables are actually references
2017-11-15 21:30:54	dchiang	in the sense that in the compiled machine code, every variable is accessed by its memory location
2017-11-15 21:31:05	dchiang	and whenever you access a variable, you implicitly dereference that memory location
2017-11-15 21:32:35	dchiang	when you call a function, say it's defined as `int f(int x) { ... }` and you call it as `f(123)`, the function makes a copy of the argument 123. this isn't something totally obvious; i assume beginning programmers have to be taught it
2017-11-15 21:32:53	dchiang	similarly when you write `y=x`, you make a copy of `x`...maybe some beginning programmers have to be taught this too
2017-11-15 21:33:16	dchiang	what the `&` notation does is suppress the copying
2017-11-15 21:35:17	dchiang	of course, the way that references are implemented is as pointers, so it's all the same underneath. but my only point is that all variables are references, and the & just suppresses a behavior that happens automatically but is not actually necessary
2017-11-15 21:37:12	jeffrey	I just don't like it because it isn't clear from a caller that its arguments can be modified
2017-11-15 21:37:29	dchiang	i see, definitely
2017-11-15 21:37:45	jeffrey	but if you had a make_reference<>(x) then it is clear
2017-11-15 21:39:16	pbui	jeffrey: dont give them ideas
2017-11-15 21:39:19	pbui	eek
2017-11-15 21:39:21	dchiang	yeah, like move(x) makes it clear that x becomes invalid. i think that could have been a good idea
2017-11-15 21:39:35	dchiang	just ref(x), easier to type :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-11-15 21:43:50	dchiang	i think i only use reference arguments when i want to return a vector or some other large object, and i make sure to make the reference argument the last argument
2017-11-15 21:44:01	dchiang	but these days the advice is to just return the vector
2017-11-15 22:27:17	cgiuffrida	@cgiuffrida uploaded a file: Screen Shot 2017-11-15 at 10.26.17 PM.png https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U3S3V47R9/F816RJRL2/screen_shot_2017-11-15_at_10.26.17_pm.png  and commented: lug coming in a strong first place

2017-11-15 22:54:29	wtheisen	there's no way #lug only has 6k messages. Or is this out of the 10k limit?
2017-11-15 22:57:44	ewilli23	Or is it per time?
2017-11-15 22:57:50	ewilli23	Like in the last month
2017-11-15 22:58:34	jeffrey	It probably adds to 10k
2017-11-15 23:02:04	ewilli23	Oh right 10k is for the entire team
2017-11-16 00:08:27	cgiuffrida	lug is taking 6k of the 10k limit I think is what the stats are showing
2017-11-16 00:43:17	jeffrey	Note to self - do not overclock CPU by 900MHz to finish homework faster
2017-11-16 00:46:24	pbui	oh...
2017-11-16 00:46:40	pbui	thnx for the pro-tip
2017-11-16 00:46:48	8bit	oh no, did you rek it
2017-11-16 00:47:35	jeffrey	I crashed it and had to rerun my code from the start
2017-11-16 00:49:10	jeffrey	Plus had to fix the whole won't boot anymore because the system was no longer stable anymore thing

This is intentional and we plan to maintain this level for the foreseeable
2017-11-16 13:57:34	pbui	future.
2017-11-16 13:57:40	pbui	also, walter.scheirer got a shoutout
2017-11-16 13:57:43	walter.scheirer	wooo
2017-11-16 13:57:45	walter.scheirer	just saw that
2017-11-16 13:58:02	pbui	The
2017-11-16 13:58:04	pbui	Department of Computer Science and Engineering and I have presented an
2017-11-16 13:58:06	pbui	additional space request to the Provost to move CSE and a portion of the
2017-11-16 13:58:08	pbui	Center for Research Computing into a restored Haggar Hall.  We hope and
2017-11-16 13:58:10	pbui	expect to hear positively on this request soon.  The initial reception to
2017-11-16 13:58:12	pbui	this proposal has been very positive and, if accepted, a move would likely
2017-11-16 13:58:14	pbui	occur in 2020 which would provide an additional 28,400 nasf.
2017-11-16 13:58:24	pbui	this is the first time ive seen this in writing from someone outside the department
2017-11-16 13:58:35	pbui	does this mean it's realistic?
2017-11-16 14:00:00	wtheisen	I️ complained on our survey about how much of a travesty it is we don’t have a lab.
2017-11-16 14:06:33	pbui	it is a travesty
2017-11-16 14:07:42	dchiang	Haggar really is starting to sound more real
2017-11-16 14:08:50	walter.scheirer	*if* the money can be found to make it happen

2017-11-16 14:26:10	pbui	as long as we get a lounge and a lab, id be happy
2017-11-16 14:26:20	pbui	NDH isnt so bad
2017-11-16 14:26:29	pbui	and parking might be better
2017-11-16 14:26:46	pbui	as long as we have classes in haggar, i think that will alleviate concerns

2017-11-16 14:55:22	pbui	wait
2017-11-16 14:55:31	pbui	so the ND tuition benefit would be taxed?
2017-11-16 14:55:35	pbui	WTF
2017-11-16 14:55:42	pbui	that's a big reason y people stick here

2017-11-16 14:55:54	tweninger	ಠ_ಠ
2017-11-16 15:06:01	pbui	i knew the tuition benefit if your spouse took a course was taxed
2017-11-16 15:06:09	pbui	that's y my wife is hesitant to use it
2017-11-16 15:06:18	pbui	but i didnt even think about my kids tuition benefit

2017-11-16 16:38:51	pbui	i used to use ksh
2017-11-16 16:39:08	pbui	it is the default on OpenBSD and one of the defaults on NetBSD
2017-11-16 16:39:11	walter.scheirer	i was on some systems back in the day where it was the only useable shell

2017-11-16 16:39:33	pbui	but now i try to be plain vanilla, so i use bash
2017-11-16 16:39:55	walter.scheirer	i prefer bourne shell scripting syntax
2017-11-16 16:39:59	walter.scheirer	because it is quick and dirty
2017-11-16 16:40:14	androidkitkat	i just had to relad my bashrc
2017-11-16 16:40:25	androidkitkat	now win launches my thing
2017-11-16 17:19:47	jeffrey	literally anything else > bash > sh
2017-11-16 17:20:46	jeffrey	and the only reason I say bash > sh is because of the `{1..7}` syntax

2017-11-16 21:35:50	jeffrey	Is spirit bombing the GRE against the rules?
2017-11-16 21:37:10	pbui	que?
2017-11-16 21:38:32	jeffrey	Goku's go to move when he can't beat someone is everyone giving him energy and then he makes a giant ball of death.
2017-11-16 21:38:53	jeffrey	So can everyone lend me not-fail-energy? Like, is that allowed?
2017-11-16 21:40:40	tweninger	Shaq is back everybody (@ssjohns). Get excited for Reddit tomorrow
2017-11-16 21:41:08	tweninger	Thanks for dinner
2017-11-16 21:41:49	jeffrey	Were you at north?
2017-11-16 21:42:40	tweninger	Shaq said that he stopped by north - we met at Brothers
2017-11-16 21:43:10	ssjohns	@jeffrey Yep! You didn't recognize me because I look so mature now!
2017-11-16 21:43:50	jeffrey	I did recognize you, and I was confused because I saw no @tweninger with shaq at north
2017-11-16 21:44:03	tweninger	Shaq has grown his hair out - shoulder length now
2017-11-16 22:02:44	jcioffi	whaat
2017-11-16 22:03:07	ccarball	pics or it didn't happen
2017-11-16 22:06:05	jcioffi	also an explanation of number 5 :pray:
2017-11-16 22:06:08	tweninger	Well I'm at home now. So no photos. You'll see his amazing ponytail tomorrow
2017-11-16 22:06:10	jcioffi	@ccarball you can do that too
2017-11-16 22:06:39	tweninger	#5 is just like lecture 31 but don't worry about the log
2017-11-16 22:06:41	ccarball	jcioffi: i can do?
2017-11-16 22:06:50	jcioffi	@ccarball u can halp me
2017-11-16 22:06:55	ccarball	ohh
2017-11-16 22:06:57	ccarball	yeaah
2017-11-16 22:06:59	ccarball	come to me
2017-11-16 22:07:03	jcioffi	shaq came up a bunch in my interview today
2017-11-16 22:07:07	jcioffi	everyone loves him
2017-11-16 22:07:31	jcioffi	@tweninger i had my final round today - find out tomorrow potentially
2017-11-16 22:07:42	tweninger	You can up at dinner too... And something about being a Russian spy
2017-11-16 22:08:12	jcioffi	_I_ came up at dinner?
2017-11-16 22:08:15	jcioffi	oh no
2017-11-16 22:08:42	tweninger	I'm shilling for you... No worries, your success is my success
2017-11-16 22:09:41	tweninger	Also... Someone later I want to know about this apparently inside joke about you and Russia
2017-11-16 22:09:49	tweninger	Sometime**
2017-11-16 22:09:56	jcioffi	OH you don't know?
2017-11-16 22:10:10	jcioffi	i thought all the faculty knew
2017-11-16 22:10:15	jcioffi	wait but then how did that come up
2017-11-16 22:10:25	tweninger	I need to do better keeping up on lug I guess
2017-11-16 22:10:36	jcioffi	lol i can explain tomorrow
2017-11-16 22:12:20	tweninger	Is q5 clear to you? I'll be heading to bed soon
2017-11-16 22:13:04	jcioffi	not really.. im trying to understand
2017-11-16 22:16:16	tweninger	Just make it look like the table in lecture 31
2017-11-16 22:16:18	a3qz	@tweninger we need to do inputs and reading before any of the operations in q5, right?
2017-11-16 22:16:29	tweninger	Yes
2017-11-16 22:16:45	a3qz	wheras in lecture 30 only one memory space is used at a time so you dont need to
2017-11-16 22:16:48	tweninger	You need to load the data before you manipulate it
2017-11-16 22:17:07	tweninger	You can use lots of memory variables
2017-11-16 22:17:14	a3qz	okay cool that was my next question
2017-11-16 22:17:17	a3qz	makes sense then, thanks
2017-11-16 22:17:44	tweninger	It's just the stack.. and the memory of a program written in, say, python
2017-11-16 22:18:02	a3qz	oh also there are little subscripts of 1 under r and w, are those significant?
2017-11-16 22:18:20	a3qz	yeah i think i didnt quite connect to the abstraction during lecture
2017-11-16 22:19:03	tweninger	R1(t,A) is just a select statement in transaction (id1) within a program execution
2017-11-16 22:19:37	tweninger	w1(t,A) is an insert or update SQL statement
2017-11-16 22:20:01	a3qz	if i then wanted to read into say (s,B), for example, would that become r2
2017-11-16 22:20:12	a3qz	or is r1 the select
2017-11-16 22:20:37	tweninger	The number is an id of a transaction
2017-11-16 22:21:31	tweninger	For HW5 I don't think those numbers are ever relevant. Transaction IDs only really matter when keeping track of multiple interleaving transactions
2017-11-16 22:21:42	tweninger	But we save that for hw6
2017-11-16 22:21:50	tweninger	Hw5 is very easy
2017-11-16 22:22:44	tweninger	Btw - who is a3qz?
2017-11-16 22:22:44	a3qz	okay that makes sense
2017-11-16 22:22:56	tweninger	squints
2017-11-16 22:23:11	a3qz	im one of the seniors in the euchre group
2017-11-16 22:23:14	a3qz	my netid is rmichale
2017-11-16 22:23:24	jcioffi	you threw marshmallows at his head first
2017-11-16 22:23:24	tweninger	What is your name:)
2017-11-16 22:23:30	a3qz	i was the first one to win the marshmallows
2017-11-16 22:23:33	a3qz	Ryan
2017-11-16 22:23:35	tweninger	Oh...
2017-11-16 22:23:54	tweninger	Ok sorry Im on the phone app I can't see this info
2017-11-16 22:23:58	a3qz	a3qz is just the handle i use for everythign
2017-11-16 22:24:22	tweninger	Marshmallows? I don't know what you're talking about
2017-11-16 22:24:29	a3qz	oh youre right
2017-11-16 22:24:33	jcioffi	_hush hush_
2017-11-16 22:24:34	a3qz	i dont even know what those are
2017-11-16 22:24:36	tweninger	;)
2017-11-16 22:25:06	jcioffi	you said youd have 24/7 office hours for me but never made it back to your office today :disappointed:
2017-11-16 22:25:33	a3qz	:frankerz:
2017-11-16 22:25:56	tweninger	Sorry... I had an of campus meeting today at 3
2017-11-16 22:26:14	tweninger	Then meetings at 10, 12, 1 and 2
2017-11-16 22:26:29	tweninger	So... Light day today
2017-11-16 22:27:02	jcioffi	average day in the life
2017-11-16 22:27:46	tweninger	@ssjohns director of tinder is changing his flight to meet with you guys tomorrow at 1030
2017-11-16 22:27:53	tweninger	I'll confirm later
2017-11-16 22:28:37	jcioffi	casual
2017-11-16 22:28:39	jcioffi	_casual_
2017-11-16 22:28:47	jcioffi	so dang casual
2017-11-16 22:29:00	a3qz	:fire:
2017-11-16 22:29:35	tweninger	Had lunch with him today... Hope to get a collaboration
2017-11-16 22:29:52	tweninger	Swipe left on the Weninger lab!
2017-11-16 22:30:37	jcioffi	_proceeds to copy table from lecture 30_
2017-11-16 22:30:53	tweninger	Consider changing the numbers
2017-11-16 22:31:47	tweninger	Also, protip what happens if a transaction is not consistent? Should the days get written?
2017-11-16 22:32:17	8bit	ooh I read about that in the book you lent me!
2017-11-16 22:33:47	jcioffi	¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2017-11-16 22:34:15	jcioffi	im gonna assume no
2017-11-16 22:36:11	tweninger	A transaction must start in a consistent State and end in a consistent State
2017-11-16 22:36:45	tweninger	Otherwise it'll needs to abort and rollback changes
2017-11-16 22:41:17	jcioffi	@tweninger what does it mean to preserve consistency when a transaction is executing
2017-11-16 22:49:23	tweninger	Headed to bed. @8bit can answer any questions that come up. Thanks!
2017-11-16 22:59:31	8bit	lol
2017-11-16 23:03:41	tweninger	@ssjohns meeting with tinder director confirmed in my office
2017-11-16 23:06:33	8bit	tweninger: do you usually offer databases both semesters?
2017-11-16 23:11:07	wtheisen	no he's doing it because there's so much demand
2017-11-16 23:18:15	8bit	Is it usually spring or fall?
2017-11-16 23:33:58	ssjohns	@tweninger Awesome! Can't wait!
2017-11-17 00:10:21	ewilli23	@walter.scheirer or anyone who’s taken security: is it programming-heavy or more conceptual?
2017-11-17 00:29:46	jeffrey	Ugh, nervous for GRE, can't sleep
2017-11-17 00:30:46	ewilli23	I just got an ad on Spotify for the USB Implementers Forum about why I should use USB…

2017-11-17 07:58:08	pbui	o7
2017-11-17 08:13:18	tweninger	@8bit - its traditionally been in the Fall. I'm not tied to that though. I may move it to Spring once the currently backlog gets flushed out
2017-11-17 08:33:33	wtheisen	gl @jeffrey you’ll do great. also security is very theory focused. There’s some programming but far less than compilers.
2017-11-17 08:33:49	walter.scheirer	@ewilli23: i wouldn't say the class is programming heavy
2017-11-17 08:33:51	walter.scheirer	there is programming
2017-11-17 08:34:10	walter.scheirer	but in well-defined exercises, not large projects
2017-11-17 09:42:45	androidkitkat	@ewilli23 maybe its targeting filthy lightning cable/port users
2017-11-17 09:43:22	pbui	androidkitkat: pay attention in moreau
2017-11-17 09:43:29	pbui	that class is very important
2017-11-17 09:43:41	catvajiac	...........
2017-11-17 09:44:11	wtheisen	I am so glad I didn't have to take that class
2017-11-17 09:44:27	catvajiac	same tho
2017-11-17 09:44:46	catvajiac	we have a version of it at smc, but we didnt really do anything so w/e
2017-11-17 09:54:24	wtheisen	I got to take a gym class where we took naps
2017-11-17 09:54:28	wtheisen	all the tie
2017-11-17 09:54:33	wtheisen	and meditate
2017-11-17 09:54:38	wtheisen	and align our chakras
2017-11-17 09:54:41	wtheisen	10/10
2017-11-17 09:55:27	ccarball	I didn't mind moreau
2017-11-17 09:55:34	ccarball	the readings were pretty good
2017-11-17 09:55:42	ccarball	the discussions sometimes were good
2017-11-17 09:55:51	ccarball	still thought it was a total waste of time though
2017-11-17 09:56:00	catvajiac	dont u guys have lots of papers to write for that
2017-11-17 09:59:11	ccarball	nope
2017-11-17 09:59:51	catvajiac	oh, someone told me that once
2017-11-17 11:33:32	jbaker10	Bring PE back. I want to take a sports class for zero credits just for fun
2017-11-17 11:57:23	jbaker10	@jeffrey lmk how it goes
2017-11-17 12:04:50	jeffrey	It went worse than my practice tests, but I'm ok
2017-11-17 12:11:16	jeffrey	Ofc, now I'm lost
2017-11-17 12:11:30	wtheisen	got the scores you needed @jeffrey
2017-11-17 12:12:48	jbaker10	I hope you got all the scores
2017-11-17 12:12:57	jbaker10	I wonder if we had the same test
2017-11-17 12:14:47	bdevorem	@jbaker10 jeffrey says what u want is illegal
2017-11-17 12:16:38	jbaker10	Curiosity is illegal?
2017-11-17 12:16:41	jbaker10	Interesting
2017-11-17 12:16:46	bdevorem	yes
2017-11-17 12:17:06	jbaker10	Woops. Let me turn my curiosity off
2017-11-17 12:17:22	bdevorem	yep, gotta keep that in check
2017-11-17 12:18:56	jbaker10	Thanks @alitteke for making my profile picture better
2017-11-17 12:36:45	jeffrey	Also I messed up the part where it asks where I go to undergrad - I thought it was asking where I want to send scores, so I gotta transfer to UMass now.

2017-11-18 13:17:35	jeffrey	My parents are making me wear jeans to the game
2017-11-18 13:21:46	wtheisen	Why is NDs app the only one that lets me put Dr. as the title for my reccs
2017-11-18 13:24:26	wtheisen	Man ND's app website is actually so slick
2017-11-18 13:24:32	wtheisen	compared to some of these other ones
2017-11-18 13:26:03	pbui	all that money we spent on it
2017-11-18 13:30:09	pbui	@alitteke: https://512pixels.net/2017/11/apple-begins-high-sierra-automatic-rollout/ 
2017-11-18 13:30:13	pbui	sounds like microsoft
2017-11-18 13:31:05	walter.scheirer	this isn't new
2017-11-18 13:31:09	walter.scheirer	and it's not automatic
2017-11-18 13:31:26	alitteke	I think it might have something to do with the filesystem switch, and the fact that there’s incompatibilities between photos taken on iOS 11 and older versions of macos
2017-11-18 13:31:37	pbui	"If you’re using OS X El Capitan v10.11.5 or later, High Sierra conveniently downloads in the background, making it even easier to upgrade your Mac. When the download has completed, you receive a notification indicating that High Sierra is ready to be installed. Click Install in the notification to get started."
2017-11-18 13:31:50	pbui	looks like it does that MS did... dl the update in the background for u
2017-11-18 13:31:58	pbui	that was quite controversial when MS did it
2017-11-18 13:32:01	alitteke	iOS does that too
2017-11-18 13:32:04	pbui	b/c it ate people's bandwidth
2017-11-18 13:32:27	alitteke	I think it downloads when people aren’t using the computer
2017-11-18 13:32:44	pbui	doesnt make it better
2017-11-18 13:32:47	pbui	:]
2017-11-18 13:32:54	walter.scheirer	haters gonna hate
2017-11-18 13:33:21	pbui	im just saying everyone hated on MS for doing this
2017-11-18 13:33:24	pbui	apple does the same
2017-11-18 13:33:27	pbui	and it's zomg, so good
2017-11-18 13:33:33	pbui	thanks apple for caring bout us
2017-11-18 13:34:00	alitteke	But that’s not what that article says
2017-11-18 13:34:14	pbui	right, this one article
2017-11-18 13:34:31	pbui	i think maybe people are waking up to the hey apple isnt so goodly idea
2017-11-18 13:35:47	alitteke	They have made lots of questionable decisions lately
2017-11-18 13:36:43	alitteke	And a lot of it with the mac
2017-11-18 13:36:53	wtheisen	holy guacamole it's 27$ per school to send scores
2017-11-18 13:36:57	wtheisen	jesus

2017-11-18 14:09:09	jeffrey	The GRE exists only to take money, I think.
2017-11-18 14:09:56	jeffrey	$200 to take it for a sense of pride and accomplishment.

2017-11-19 21:46:25	walter.scheirer	http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/1711.2/01701.html 
2017-11-19 21:46:38	pbui	https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/7e1jo1/raising_the_taxes_of_graduate_students_by_as_much/ 
2017-11-19 21:47:04	walter.scheirer	ND sent an email to the grad students saying they are exempt
2017-11-19 21:47:11	walter.scheirer	with respect to the bill's current language
2017-11-19 21:47:14	pbui	oh?
2017-11-19 21:47:16	pbui	nice
2017-11-19 21:47:18	pbui	that's good
2017-11-19 21:47:22	pbui	how does that work
2017-11-19 21:47:36	pbui	also, yeah, linus is very strict about not breaking things
2017-11-19 21:48:20	walter.scheirer	"Notre Dame does not offer tuition remission or tuition reduction to its teaching and research assistants. It offers tuition scholarships to its admitted students, regardless of their role. In cases where a student may cease to be a research assistant, the tuition scholarship remains. It is not a benefit of the assistantship. (Note: This is likely not the case for Assistant Rectors receiving tuition support as a part of their assistantship.)"
2017-11-19 21:51:22	pbui	so if it is a "scholarship" we are ok
2017-11-19 21:51:31	pbui	why doesnt everyone make it a scholarship then
2017-11-19 21:51:54	walter.scheirer	i am sure other schools are onto this...
2017-11-19 21:52:12	pbui	how about our tuition benefits?
2017-11-19 21:52:17	pbui	like if my kids go to college
2017-11-19 21:52:21	pbui	is that still taxed?
2017-11-19 21:56:17	walter.scheirer	unfortunately, as far as i can tell, that will be taxed
2017-11-19 21:59:29	pbui	yay

2017-11-20 11:34:49	pbui	Also, the email was to people in the class, so that is permissible

2017-11-20 13:12:53	wmarkley	Why do people consider OpenBSD more secure than Linux? Is it just the auditing?
2017-11-20 13:13:15	pbui	more aggressive about adding security features
2017-11-20 13:13:26	pbui	they are more aggressive about cutting dead code
2017-11-20 13:15:42	wmarkley	Interesting.  I may try for my home server
2017-11-20 13:18:25	pbui	openbsd has a terrible filesystem
2017-11-20 13:19:38	androidkitkat	install gentoo

2017-11-20 13:27:14	androidkitkat	more or less
2017-11-20 13:29:02	pbui	pretty much
2017-11-20 13:29:22	wmarkley	@androidkitkat are you saying pure gentoo or the Gentoo/OpenBSD port
2017-11-20 13:29:23	androidkitkat	ok but 2 TB of Seagate is $20 more than 1 TB WD
2017-11-20 13:29:28	androidkitkat	pure gentoo
2017-11-20 13:30:47	walter.scheirer	is that like pure michigan?
2017-11-20 13:31:39	androidkitkat	a 3TB Seagate drive is only 2 more dollars than a 2 TB Seagate Drive
2017-11-20 13:32:01	walter.scheirer	one wonders about the difference in quality
2017-11-20 13:32:22	androidkitkat	higher price == better quality rite
2017-11-20 13:32:55	flynn	slightly thicker layer of magnetic spackle

2017-11-20 14:12:02	pbui	felt like old times
2017-11-20 14:12:14	androidkitkat	Don't you have a degree in OS
2017-11-20 14:12:19	pbui	NO I DONT
2017-11-20 14:12:29	pbui	my systems dont operate
2017-11-20 14:12:33	pbui	they may be distributed
2017-11-20 14:12:52	androidkitkat	Rapid unplanned dissembly
2017-11-20 14:13:17	pbui	androidkitkat: y dont u get ur sister a SSD?
2017-11-20 14:13:29	androidkitkat	I have an SSD and an HDD
2017-11-20 14:13:35	androidkitkat	SSD for boot
2017-11-20 14:13:42	androidkitkat	HDD for storage
2017-11-20 14:14:13	androidkitkat	And a GTX 1060
2017-11-20 14:14:20	androidkitkat	Ryzen 5 1600
2017-11-20 14:14:26	androidkitkat	8 GB ram
2017-11-20 14:14:48	androidkitkat	Some b350m board
2017-11-20 14:15:49	androidkitkat	Or she gets a prebuilt dell
2017-11-20 14:19:53	androidkitkat	Wow I'm in the first at least 15 minutes of the podcast
2017-11-20 14:24:44	jeffrey	That would be a very solid build
2017-11-20 14:25:13	androidkitkat	Ik @jeffrey but she also wants a monitor with it for under $1k
2017-11-20 14:26:35	jeffrey	Seems doable with one or two deals
2017-11-20 14:27:13	jeffrey	Though I guess you'd want Windows on it
2017-11-20 14:27:44	androidkitkat	She would
2017-11-20 14:27:51	androidkitkat	It's tight
2017-11-20 14:27:56	androidkitkat	Def needs sales
2017-11-20 14:28:21	androidkitkat	Although Dell prebuilt ryzen 5 with rx 580 for $850 isn't too shabby either
2017-11-20 14:29:21	jeffrey	Does that include a monitor and ssd, or no?
2017-11-20 14:29:52	androidkitkat	No SSD or monitor
2017-11-20 14:30:19	androidkitkat	But she wouldn't really not notice no SSD tbh
2017-11-20 14:30:21	androidkitkat	But she wants one
2017-11-20 14:32:10	androidkitkat	And a "good monitor"
2017-11-20 14:32:35	jeffrey	How good? I'd say any 1080p IPS is "good"
2017-11-20 14:32:45	androidkitkat	That's what I'd say too
2017-11-20 14:33:04	androidkitkat	23.8 would be ideal size I bet
2017-11-20 14:35:23	pbui	androidkitkat: do u want to be the tech support?
2017-11-20 14:35:41	androidkitkat	That's the only issue with a custom build
2017-11-20 14:36:06	androidkitkat	If I build it. I fix it
2017-11-20 14:45:01	androidkitkat	Nice commerical break

2017-11-20 17:52:45	ewilli23	Keyboard also doesn’t work in bios to get into boot menu etc
2017-11-20 17:53:19	ewilli23	Pretty sure it’s a hardware issue at this point but I’m just afraid of what it’s going to cost
2017-11-20 17:55:17	ewilli23	The power button still works though
2017-11-20 18:01:41	androidkitkat	@ewilli23 can you even do cmd+s on startup for a command line?
2017-11-20 18:04:12	ewilli23	With a usb keyboard, yeah
2017-11-20 18:07:54	androidkitkat	okay yeah thats not good if ur built in mac kb cant
2017-11-20 22:31:18	jeffrey	tfw you write all your results for a homework, then find a fundamental mistake in your code
2017-11-20 22:31:40	walter.scheirer	at least you found it...
2017-11-20 22:31:42	pbui	isnt that everytime

2017-11-21 18:06:55	pbui	another kernel update

2017-11-21 18:36:59	jeffrey	Biometrics didn't seem like too much work, but I only took it for a few weeks before trading it for research.
2017-11-21 18:38:21	myle_killer	Okay yeah I was trying to do like a security oriented semester but I don’t want to bite off more than I can chew

2017-11-21 18:49:32	ssjohns	@pbui Are you talking about net neutrality in your class? What do you think is the chance it
2017-11-21 18:49:37	ssjohns	is voted out
2017-11-21 18:49:45	pbui	already did
2017-11-21 18:49:57	pbui	told them what was happening
2017-11-21 18:50:11	pbui	one student said they plan on writing to their congress critters
2017-11-21 18:50:21	pbui	im pretty sure net neutrality is dead
2017-11-21 18:50:28	pbui	elections have consequences
2017-11-21 18:51:42	ssjohns	So many consequences. This is sad, but at least all those towns are building out their own internet infrastructures.
2017-11-21 18:52:03	ssjohns	That's probably one good thing that will result.
2017-11-21 18:52:12	pbui	ajit pai wants it dead
2017-11-21 18:52:16	pbui	republicans want it dead
2017-11-21 18:52:22	pbui	nothing the public can do
2017-11-21 18:52:39	pbui	but it's ok, b/c free market!
2017-11-21 18:52:45	pbui	i ll just switch ISPs!
2017-11-21 18:55:22	ssjohns	I mean, there aren't many other ISPs though. Out here at least one of my only options was Comcast unless I wanted to jump through like 20,000 hoops. And this place should be the best in the country for that sort of thing.
2017-11-21 18:56:01	ssjohns	I feel like, sadly, most people don't have that option. And what's to stop your new ISP from doing the same thing?
2017-11-21 18:57:16	pbui	yeah, i was being sarcastic
2017-11-21 18:57:25	pbui	i think 80% of america has a choice of 1 or 2 ISPs
2017-11-21 19:16:19	jeffrey	But it's not a free market
2017-11-21 19:16:49	jeffrey	Like, the FCC kind of helps that
2017-11-21 19:17:18	jeffrey	They're the reason nerds don't set up a giant radio mess network
2017-11-21 19:21:16	jeffrey	The FCC is the EA of the US government
2017-11-21 19:22:14	pbui	can u bring their stock down?

2017-11-21 19:23:07	pbui	rip
2017-11-21 19:24:32	ssjohns	What? That was sadly really fast. Is that even ethical at that point? Like when did the FCC basically give itself the power to do whatever it wanted?
2017-11-21 19:25:00	pbui	state's rights until not
2017-11-21 19:25:01	pbui	lol
2017-11-21 19:25:49	ssjohns	I don't know, it's all in the hivemind. They can probably do whatever they want. I mean if people started rioting then maybe things would change, but besides that I'm counting on the big G to start handing out free wifi.
2017-11-21 19:26:13	pbui	y
2017-11-21 19:26:21	ssjohns	I think Google had plans with a few cities to make wifi free city wide, but the cities never had an incentive to do it.
2017-11-21 19:26:27	pbui	y just google w/ internet that's worse
2017-11-21 19:27:20	ssjohns	Like the cities were fine with how things were currently so they didn't really pursue it. And I think it's fine, google alreay know everything about me. If they can kill comcast in the process I'd be fine with that.
2017-11-21 19:28:30	pbui	"Senior FCC officials also provided some more details on the rollback of federal net neutrality rules. For the most part, all consumer protections in the 2015 net neutrality order are being eliminated. That goes beyond the core net neutrality rules that outlaw blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization."
2017-11-21 19:28:41	pbui	"For example, rules requiring disclosure of hidden fees and data caps will be overturned. "
2017-11-21 19:28:43	pbui	oh great
2017-11-21 19:29:04	pbui	get ready for bogus "having internet fee"
2017-11-21 19:30:22	ssjohns	*Oh you want to access google instead of bing. Sorry that's a small fee.
2017-11-21 19:30:55	ssjohns	@walter.scheirer Did you ever get rid of that cable package you dont use?
2017-11-21 19:31:23	jeffrey	You can't overturn rules on disclosing what you are charging people for
2017-11-21 19:32:08	pbui	sure u can, just take it up w/ the FTC
2017-11-21 19:32:11	jeffrey	Get rid of these fake conservatives
2017-11-21 19:32:33	pbui	how can u be for state's rights and then disallow states from doing things on their own
2017-11-21 19:32:54	jeffrey	Ikr
2017-11-21 19:33:12	pbui	w/e, i doubt indiana would do anything about net neutrality
2017-11-21 19:34:34	jeffrey	Get ND to build our own internet
2017-11-21 19:34:45	jeffrey	Cut out deal with Comcast

2017-11-21 19:35:15	pbui	does comcast still provide the internet in the dorms?
2017-11-21 19:35:23	jeffrey	Pay for infrastructure connecting South bend and ND, and then ND to non-comcast
2017-11-21 19:35:36	jeffrey	I believe so, i get bills from them
2017-11-21 19:35:46	pbui	really?
2017-11-21 19:35:53	jeffrey	For $0
2017-11-21 19:36:06	pbui	i looked into non-comcast/non-att internet
2017-11-21 19:36:08	pbui	nothing good
2017-11-21 19:36:17	pbui	although there are some commercial services
2017-11-21 19:36:23	pbui	but it's way out of my price range
2017-11-21 19:37:05	ssjohns	I think it's because they had a monopoly for a long time and they blocked anyone else from setting up their own internet architectures.
2017-11-21 19:37:53	ssjohns	GFiber had to overturn like a dozen lawsuits from current ISPs to get access to the telephone poles(? or something like that) in a bunch of cities when they were building out.
2017-11-21 19:38:04	pbui	yeah
2017-11-21 19:38:16	pbui	but part of that situation is the gov's fault
2017-11-21 19:38:24	ssjohns	At some point the system is just completely corrupt and only looking out for those in power.
2017-11-21 19:38:31	pbui	agreed
2017-11-21 19:38:56	jeffrey	I'm waiting for the middle class to rise up
2017-11-21 19:39:16	jeffrey	Seize the means of communication
2017-11-21 19:39:33	pbui	ram radio?
2017-11-21 19:44:38	walter.scheirer	for the record, i am still paying for cabe tv i don't watch
2017-11-21 19:45:09	walter.scheirer	maybe i should switch to ram(?) radio
2017-11-21 19:58:37	jeffrey	How does ethics work with podcasts and blog posts?
2017-11-21 19:59:00	pbui	ham radio
2017-11-21 19:59:02	pbui	lol
2017-11-21 19:59:06	pbui	jeffrey: what do u mean
2017-11-21 19:59:15	pbui	u make podcasts for some of the projects
2017-11-21 19:59:19	pbui	blog posts every week
2017-11-21 19:59:46	walter.scheirer	the podcasts are then distributed via ram radio to operators around the globe
2017-11-21 20:00:00	pbui	in morse code
2017-11-21 20:01:26	jeffrey	I wanna do podcasts frequently
2017-11-21 20:01:44	pbui	u can, but we only require 4ish

2017-11-21 20:11:33	jeffrey	If I were an EA employee, I would tell everyone I could that the whole company is in favor of protecting net neutrality. This will generate positive publicity, and if they don't fire me, they'd surely promote me.
2017-11-21 20:12:35	jeffrey	Other companies would bandwagon, and the change will fail.
2017-11-21 20:16:02	walter.scheirer	simple solution: use a proxy server to route your traffic through a country with more favorable regulautions
2017-11-21 20:20:02	flynn	Lawsuits are guaranteed on the net neutrality rule changes.  Will be tied up in the courts for months/years.  Preemption of state laws is a big deal and will test states’ rights precedents. Going to be a mess.
2017-11-21 20:20:49	flynn	In the meantime we can get municipal mesh networks established.
2017-11-21 20:21:05	walter.scheirer	yes!

2017-11-21 21:00:51	jeffrey	So, at 11 Thain canceled our 3PM meeting. But then at 1PM he asked if we could meet at 2PM, and in that time gap I had decided to go to sleep; do I email him an apology?
2017-11-21 21:03:43	8bit	never hurts
2017-11-21 21:03:59	jeffrey	Do I say 'I was sleeping?'

2017-11-21 21:07:52	jeffrey	sidenote, I feel like the mascot from Big Hero 6 who wears his underwear like 4 ways - I connect my thinkpad to the free wifi, then my other laptop to the free wifi, and then I change the mac address of the thinkpad, and then the mac address of the other laptop.

2017-11-22 10:55:44	flynn	Interesting policy-wonk (and - fair warning - libertarian) perspective on the recent net neutrality changes from Megan McArdle: https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-21/the-internet-had-already-lost-its-neutrality 
2017-11-22 10:59:01	pbui	i think that is a fair point (censorship), but it has nothing to do w/ net neutrality
2017-11-22 10:59:13	pbui	we actually talk about both things in ethics
2017-11-22 11:00:34	walter.scheirer	one thing to reflect on: the Internet was not designed with neutrality in mind
2017-11-22 11:00:54	walter.scheirer	it was designed to be operated by one provider: the government
2017-11-22 11:01:36	pbui	i think the bigger picture question for net neutrality is whether or not internet access is a utility (ie. electricity)
2017-11-22 11:01:47	walter.scheirer	we now have a network being used in a way that the original designers did not intend
2017-11-22 11:02:30	pbui	if u think of roads, we have fast lanes and toll roads in addition to normal public roads
2017-11-22 11:02:46	pbui	the question is are we comfortable w/ that on the internet
2017-11-22 11:04:12	pbui	i actually agree w/ some folks that net neutrality is only a bandaid, and the real problem is the lack of competition in the ISP space
2017-11-22 11:04:30	pbui	if a free market existed, then we wouldnt need net neutrality
2017-11-22 11:04:37	pbui	but w/out it, what can u do
2017-11-22 11:09:41	walter.scheirer	see @flynn's comment above about municipal mesh networks
2017-11-22 11:09:43	walter.scheirer	:stuck_out_tongue:
2017-11-22 11:29:56	flynn	I played with mesh networking for a consulting gig several years ago. Lesson zero: choose your routing algorithm carefully. If you don't, it will be very very bad.

2017-11-22 11:31:46	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-22 11:49:00	pbui	thinking about possible sophomore/junior level electives, i think i would be willing to do a sys admin or network programming w/ raspberry pi type course
2017-11-22 11:50:24	pbui	maybe even a very basic embedded class
2017-11-22 11:50:37	pbui	then again the web apps class makes sense at that leel too
2017-11-22 11:50:39	pbui	level*
2017-11-22 11:53:49	wtheisen	embedded
2017-11-22 11:54:09	pbui	it would have to be very basic
2017-11-22 11:54:13	pbui	since i dont know much about it
2017-11-22 11:54:27	pbui	but if the target is sophs/juniors that might be ok
2017-11-22 11:55:54	wtheisen	that's one area we have basically NO chances to take a class relating to it
2017-11-22 11:56:53	wtheisen	also has anyone dropped hist of vidya yet?
2017-11-22 11:57:28	flynn	EE has an IoT frosh course; it uses Arduino, I think. I don't see why we couldn't do a basic embedded RPi course with similar sensor/actuator bits but more elaborate programming
2017-11-22 12:02:11	pbui	yeah, i agree, i just dont have experience in it
2017-11-22 12:02:22	pbui	but i think it would be a great fit for soph/junior year
2017-11-22 12:02:29	pbui	b/c u just need basic programming skills
2017-11-22 12:02:37	pbui	u dont necessarily need ds or os
2017-11-22 12:02:43	pbui	or theory or comp arch
2017-11-22 12:05:44	flynn	yep; could be python based; and you could learn some basic network client techniques (data logging API on a server; the Pi connects to it and reports JSON bits of data from various I2C sensors you attach to it)
2017-11-22 12:06:10	pbui	yeah, i would go the python route
2017-11-22 12:06:27	wtheisen	pff use C
2017-11-22 12:06:35	pbui	wtheisen: be calm
2017-11-22 12:06:49	wtheisen	that'll be embedded II
2017-11-22 12:07:04	pbui	that would make a lot of sense

2017-11-22 12:09:05	flynn	pbui: any uptake on those Pis I contributed to lug?
2017-11-22 12:09:56	flynn	MSU has a big cluster of Pis in a hallway display case in their engineering bldg, all blinking away.  We could do that in the CSE display case ...
2017-11-22 12:10:27	pbui	flynn: no, they havent been used yet
2017-11-22 12:10:50	pbui	well, someone used one of them briefly
2017-11-22 12:10:53	pbui	but not for a project
2017-11-22 12:11:14	pbui	or not a side project (i think they borrowed for the CPEG senior capstone)
2017-11-22 12:11:19	flynn	nbd - no urgency to deploy them, just an idle thought
2017-11-22 12:13:54	pbui	wtheisen: 40 / 40 in HoC
2017-11-22 12:13:57	pbui	so no, no drops

2017-11-22 12:19:24	walter.scheirer	i'm working on my medium post: "Why I'm leaving the Internet"
2017-11-22 12:19:58	pbui	i think the growing power of google, facebook, etc. is problematic
2017-11-22 12:21:39	pbui	anyway, the next ethics project has an option to write a letter to a newspaper or to a gov rep about net neutrality
2017-11-22 12:21:45	pbui	we ll see what the students do :]
2017-11-22 12:27:28	flynn	Every wifi router should have two or more radios and the extra radios should be configured to search/join an open mesh network. At my house in snooty low-density Granger, the router in my basement can see at least six other wifi networks all of the time.  So much connectivity, so poorly used.
2017-11-22 12:28:31	pbui	w/ xfinity, u can connect to other people's wifi
2017-11-22 12:28:55	pbui	b/c their ISP issued routers broadcast xfinitywifi on one of the radios
2017-11-22 12:29:03	pbui	and that is public to anyone w/ an account
2017-11-22 12:29:18	pbui	has used this before
2017-11-22 12:29:39	walter.scheirer	yeah, i use xfinitywifi all of the time
2017-11-22 12:29:44	pbui	i wonder if this could be something organized as part of the home owners association
2017-11-22 12:30:02	pbui	like have the neighborhood pay for fiber to some point in the neighborhood
2017-11-22 12:30:13	pbui	and then each home connects to this fiber
2017-11-22 12:31:52	flynn	I use it all the time too but it's not a mesh (no local routing).   The problem with organized meshes like this is that the ISP you (eventually) have to connect to will want to charge you commercial rates because of the traffic you generate.
2017-11-22 12:34:34	pbui	ND cant even get eduroam to work properly, i have little faith in a wireless mesh
2017-11-22 12:34:36	pbui	:|
2017-11-22 12:36:02	flynn	I suspect the problem with eduroam is auth
2017-11-22 12:36:24	flynn	Easy to get the low level connection but seems to take a long time to get through shibboleth
2017-11-22 12:37:35	pbui	im just very wary of wireless
2017-11-22 12:37:37	flynn	and sometimes you never get it. Quite hit-or-miss
2017-11-22 12:37:50	pbui	my ps3 disconnects from my router a lot
2017-11-22 12:37:59	pbui	but that could be b/c it's pretty old
2017-11-22 12:38:13	pbui	my rpi doesnt disconnect as often
2017-11-22 12:39:05	pbui	i want to switch to wired, but i dont want to run cable in my house... not handy like tweninger :]
2017-11-22 12:41:05	flynn	I have never quite understood why wifi connections (even low level pre-auth) take such a random amount of time. When we switched to comcast I was impressed by the connection speed for wifi; like <2 seconds, reliably. Anywhere else, you wait forever. What exactly is it doing that takes this hugely variable amount of time?  Is it interference? Is it going out somewhere to authenticate you in some way? I guess I've been in too many airports...
2017-11-22 12:53:02	jcioffi	wishing @walter.scheirer had already given his wifi talk since I have to sped two hours in the airport
2017-11-22 12:53:12	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-11-22 12:53:29	walter.scheirer	at least it will happen before winter break

2017-11-22 13:55:55	flynn	aah, that proprietary and essential hardware that nobody else makes
2017-11-22 13:56:06	pbui	like what is the controversy?
2017-11-22 14:06:18	silv3r	It’s probably because the original battlefronts were amazing games and all the nostalgic gamers are mad
2017-11-22 14:07:59	silv3r	The first remake last year was bad, not close to the originals at all. This one seems much more like the originals, and everyone was excited, which is why everyone is so upset they are ruining it, since it looks like a great game
2017-11-22 14:08:11	silv3r	-my $0.02
2017-11-22 14:08:12	walter.scheirer	and it looks like the workstation will need to be reinstalled to get this to work
2017-11-22 14:14:57	pbui	silv3r: yeah, but people make bad games all the time
2017-11-22 14:15:00	pbui	especially remakes
2017-11-22 14:15:04	pbui	why the massive vitriol
2017-11-22 14:15:14	silv3r	Because battlefront man
2017-11-22 14:15:18	silv3r	Did you ever play that?
2017-11-22 14:15:24	silv3r	That was my childhood
2017-11-22 14:15:26	pbui	no
2017-11-22 14:15:30	silv3r	Smh
2017-11-22 14:15:38	silv3r	So many days in my friends basement playing that game
2017-11-22 14:16:05	silv3r	It would be like if halo was dead for 10 years then they make a bad remake that is pay to win

2017-11-22 14:18:04	pbui	a medium post!
2017-11-22 15:59:23	jeffrey	Charging for software is bad. Charging for access to the ability to unlock things is bad. Charging for a chance to unlock something is bad.
2017-11-22 15:59:53	jeffrey	The EA thing is just the straw that broke the camel's back.
2017-11-22 16:00:41	jeffrey	I don't buy loot boxes, and I also rarely spend more than $5 on a game.
2017-11-22 16:03:13	ssjohns	>Charging for software is bad.
2017-11-22 16:03:13	ssjohns	B Gates would disagree on that front.
2017-11-22 16:04:58	jeffrey	Also, what if we got Firefox and Chrome to use tor by default? Would that in some way break any "fast lane" ISP deals?

2017-11-23 16:40:47	pbui	the whole current government agenda doesnt care what people think
2017-11-23 16:40:51	walter.scheirer	i'm sure comcast was never even compliant with the obama era regulations
2017-11-23 16:40:59	walter.scheirer	companies keep money on hand to pay fines
2017-11-23 16:41:05	walter.scheirer	and go about doing whatever they want
2017-11-23 16:41:14	walter.scheirer	the classic example of this is environmental regulations
2017-11-23 16:41:19	pbui	like, i dont see how people dont realize how everything is done for corporations at this point
2017-11-23 16:41:27	pbui	and not normal everyday citizens
2017-11-23 16:41:44	pbui	like the tax cuts...
2017-11-23 16:41:46	pbui	come on man
2017-11-23 16:42:32	walter.scheirer	the only change here is that companies will potentially lower the amount they are paying in fines
2017-11-23 16:42:38	walter.scheirer	i see no practical change
2017-11-23 16:42:42	walter.scheirer	for users
2017-11-23 17:04:02	jeffrey	It's just a matter of time before SSL is illegal
2017-11-23 19:21:46	wtheisen	@walter.scheirer what do you think of the linux 0 days being dropped via twitter

2017-11-24 10:43:29	pbui	Yes, I can give for free

2017-11-24 10:46:26	pbui	not core 2 duo
2017-11-24 10:46:33	pbui	it is a 32-bit cpu
2017-11-24 10:46:36	pbui	that i am certain
2017-11-24 10:46:45	pbui	the last 32-bit machine
2017-11-24 10:47:00	androidkitkat	17 or 20 inch?
2017-11-24 10:47:03	pbui	20

2017-11-24 10:47:21	pbui	the irony
2017-11-24 10:47:27	androidkitkat	Although i'm not entirely sure
2017-11-24 10:48:08	androidkitkat	i've watched a lot of youtube videos of people trying to get windows 98 running on a Core 2 Duo 2007 MacBook and DOS just refuses to install
2017-11-24 10:48:11	androidkitkat	but i will try
2017-11-24 10:48:14	pbui	yeah

2017-11-24 10:48:54	pbui	i cant make any guarantees other than it should poweron
2017-11-24 10:49:01	androidkitkat	That's fine with me
2017-11-24 10:49:13	pbui	aight, i can bring it to my office next week
2017-11-24 10:49:15	androidkitkat	Never had a Mac and a legacy Mac is best mac

2017-11-24 10:49:31	androidkitkat	Ofc
2017-11-24 10:49:43	pbui	it mostly has my wife's stuff on it
2017-11-24 10:50:11	pbui	im gonna try to retire my atom file server
2017-11-24 10:50:17	pbui	it's had a good run... 10 years
2017-11-24 10:50:27	androidkitkat	A file server on an Intel atom?
2017-11-24 10:50:30	pbui	yeah
2017-11-24 10:50:36	androidkitkat	Atom?
2017-11-24 10:50:39	pbui	yeah
2017-11-24 10:50:46	androidkitkat	The really underpowered mobile chipset
2017-11-24 10:50:46	pbui	64-bit atom
2017-11-24 10:50:49	pbui	yes
2017-11-24 10:50:58	androidkitkat	O my
2017-11-24 10:51:06	pbui	Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU  330   @ 1.60GHz
2017-11-24 10:51:15	pbui	it's been a solid file server
2017-11-24 10:51:20	pbui	just getting long in the tooth
2017-11-24 10:51:36	pbui	gonna use my wife's intel nuc as the file server now
2017-11-24 10:51:45	androidkitkat	You a have a nuc?
2017-11-24 10:51:47	androidkitkat	That's lefit
2017-11-24 10:51:54	androidkitkat	Legit
2017-11-24 10:52:05	pbui	Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-5010U CPU @ 2.10GHz
2017-11-24 10:52:16	androidkitkat	I think I have one of those chips
2017-11-24 10:52:42	androidkitkat	Not the U varient
2017-11-24 10:52:48	pbui	the nuc is probably my most powerful machine
2017-11-24 10:52:50	pbui	outside of xavier
2017-11-24 10:53:09	androidkitkat	You should get an xserve
2017-11-24 10:53:12	pbui	lol
2017-11-24 10:53:21	pbui	what is ur obsession w/ xserves
2017-11-24 10:53:23	androidkitkat	Server racks are on sale
2017-11-24 10:53:30	androidkitkat	It's a rack mounted Mac
2017-11-24 10:53:35	pbui	im moving away from big machines
2017-11-24 10:53:43	pbui	to small quiet things
2017-11-24 10:53:56	androidkitkat	Mac Minis make good Apache web servers
2017-11-24 10:56:03	pbui	so do atoms
2017-11-24 10:56:05	pbui	:]
2017-11-24 10:58:51	walter.scheirer	https://medium.com/@zackkanter/open-sourcing-marc-andreessens-library-ab263bc11367 
2017-11-24 10:59:03	walter.scheirer	+10000 on moving away from big machines
2017-11-24 10:59:26	walter.scheirer	i did this a few years ago, and it was the right move
2017-11-24 10:59:44	walter.scheirer	the decreased noise level made listening to music more enjoyable
2017-11-24 10:59:54	walter.scheirer	and i cut my power bill
2017-11-24 10:59:57	walter.scheirer	by quite a bit
2017-11-24 11:00:06	androidkitkat	Oh yeah that's a thing
2017-11-24 11:00:27	androidkitkat	Power Bills I think are going to be the biggest annoyance for me
2017-11-24 11:01:16	walter.scheirer	there are so many great, low-power, low-cost hardware options these days
2017-11-24 11:01:20	walter.scheirer	if you want to run some stuff at home
2017-11-24 11:01:54	androidkitkat	But I enjoy big rack mounted servers
2017-11-24 11:02:18	androidkitkat	Which is a real dilemma
2017-11-24 11:03:06	walter.scheirer	believe it or not, colo is still a thing
2017-11-24 11:03:16	walter.scheirer	you can have a rack, just don't put it in your dorm
2017-11-24 11:04:10	pbui	but the romance of it!
2017-11-24 11:04:36	walter.scheirer	dude, there's no romance there
2017-11-24 11:04:43	walter.scheirer	it's hot, noisy and expensive
2017-11-24 11:04:55	pbui	:|
2017-11-24 11:05:06	pbui	hot is ok, south bend heater
2017-11-24 11:05:12	walter.scheirer	when i used to do that stuff, i had tinfoil on my windows
2017-11-24 11:05:14	pbui	noisy, that's y we have music
2017-11-24 11:05:21	pbui	expensive, the school pays electricity
2017-11-24 11:05:21	walter.scheirer	to help control the heat
2017-11-24 11:05:28	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-24 11:05:29	walter.scheirer	true
2017-11-24 11:06:00	walter.scheirer	i guess if you're trashpicking equipment, the physical setup is free
2017-11-24 11:06:11	androidkitkat	Wait the universe get upset if I ran a server in my dorm
2017-11-24 11:06:14	androidkitkat	University*
2017-11-24 11:06:17	walter.scheirer	probably
2017-11-24 11:06:28	androidkitkat	How upset
2017-11-24 11:06:54	androidkitkat	I already run my desktop at 100% 24/7 for folding@home
2017-11-24 11:07:20	walter.scheirer	the firewall blocks almost everything
2017-11-24 11:07:34	walter.scheirer	so it wouldn't be a particularly useful server
2017-11-24 11:07:40	walter.scheirer	outside of VPN
2017-11-24 11:08:10	androidkitkat	I do have like 4 years of free VPN with Private Internet Access
2017-11-24 11:22:11	pbui	UGH ANOTHER KERNEL UPDATE
2017-11-24 11:22:13	pbui	come on greg

2017-11-24 12:29:12	alitteke	Yes
2017-11-24 12:29:18	androidkitkat	Snow Leopard?
2017-11-24 12:29:20	alitteke	I have snow leopard
2017-11-24 12:29:44	androidkitkat	Ok I'm probably going to need to Barrow it if you'd let me for this imac of buis
2017-11-24 12:30:11	alitteke	Yeah, I’ll bring it up with me
2017-11-24 12:30:29	androidkitkat	Thanks
2017-11-24 12:35:17	jcioffi	@jeffrey my dad just called me jeff
2017-11-24 14:25:23	jeffrey	Why
2017-11-24 14:28:26	jbaker10	Why
2017-11-24 14:31:38	pbui	Why
2017-11-24 14:31:59	wtheisen	Why
2017-11-24 14:34:50	pbui	wtheisen: i just listened to a podcast about the alt-right and how it talked about 4chan
2017-11-24 14:35:10	pbui	about how 4chan was a refuge for males who experience a lot of rejection in their personal lives
2017-11-24 14:35:17	pbui	i was like... i see it
2017-11-24 14:35:29	pbui	:ok_hand:
2017-11-24 14:35:36	wtheisen	dude cmon. 4chan hates the alt-right tho
2017-11-24 14:36:11	pbui	4chan loves chaos
2017-11-24 14:37:46	pbui	also, in one podcast i learned that europe has strong data protection laws
2017-11-24 14:38:06	pbui	and that if our data is processed in data center overseas, we have the right to ask for that data
2017-11-24 14:38:46	pbui	this came up in the context of cambridge analytica... who apparently stores us voter profiles in the uk and has a parent company that works for foreign govs and militaries...
2017-11-24 14:40:01	pbui	was outside doing yardwork... listened to a lot of podcasts at 1.25x
2017-11-24 14:40:20	pbui	now it's time to get back to work... making OS reading assignments
2017-11-24 15:10:53	pbui	oh wow
2017-11-24 15:10:59	pbui	pitt is gonna pull off the upset?
2017-11-24 15:14:40	walter.scheirer	wohhh
2017-11-24 15:15:21	walter.scheirer	isn't this like one of 20 rare events that must happen for ND to make the playoffs?
2017-11-24 15:19:58	pbui	we still wont make it
2017-11-24 15:20:04	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-24 15:20:05	pbui	i think wisconsin had to lose last week
2017-11-24 15:20:07	pbui	but still
2017-11-24 15:20:09	pbui	chaos
2017-11-24 15:20:15	pbui	chaos is always good
2017-11-24 15:20:29	walter.scheirer	yeah, this would be very boring
2017-11-24 15:20:42	walter.scheirer	if the outcome of each game could be predicted ahead of tme
2017-11-24 15:21:33	pbui	whoa
2017-11-24 15:21:38	pbui	miami just scored a td
2017-11-24 15:21:44	pbui	and recovered an onside kick
2017-11-24 15:21:46	pbui	lol
2017-11-24 15:21:48	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-24 15:21:51	pbui	it's not over yet
2017-11-24 15:22:01	walter.scheirer	big 2 minutes left in this game
2017-11-24 15:28:01	pbui	pitt w/ the strip1
2017-11-24 15:28:05	pbui	game over
2017-11-24 15:45:56	pbui	south florida already up on ucf
2017-11-24 15:46:46	pbui	nvm, tied game
2017-11-24 15:46:52	pbui	come on chaos
2017-11-24 16:04:10	wtheisen	wait important question. Fellowship at grad school is not synonymous with getting paid? Like I️ don’t have to apply by the fellowship deadlines?
2017-11-24 16:10:40	pbui	no, u dont
2017-11-24 16:13:41	walter.scheirer	our department should think about holding a some sort of "applying to grad school" panel
2017-11-24 16:14:00	walter.scheirer	i think it would be helpful to cover stuff like what @wtheisen is asking
2017-11-24 16:14:46	ccarball	^^
2017-11-24 16:18:40	pbui	walter.scheirer: yeah, actually it would be useful
2017-11-24 16:18:49	pbui	i had intended to hold a panel earlier in the semester
2017-11-24 16:18:57	pbui	but lack of motivation and time prevented that
2017-11-24 16:19:08	walter.scheirer	haha
2017-11-24 16:19:09	pbui	but if u want to lead/organize something, many students would appreciate it
2017-11-24 16:19:12	walter.scheirer	probably too late now
2017-11-24 16:19:14	pbui	srs
2017-11-24 16:19:14	walter.scheirer	but next year...
2017-11-24 16:19:17	pbui	i dont think so
2017-11-24 16:19:22	walter.scheirer	really?
2017-11-24 16:19:22	jeffrey	I wish I had considered it much earlier
2017-11-24 16:19:30	jeffrey	Now I'm sprinting
2017-11-24 16:19:31	walter.scheirer	aren't most apps due in the next week?
2017-11-24 16:19:32	pbui	yeah, u can still hit the juniors
2017-11-24 16:19:35	walter.scheirer	oh yeah
2017-11-24 16:19:45	walter.scheirer	anyway, it's not going to happen before the end of the semester
2017-11-24 16:19:49	jeffrey	Most are due Dec 15 or Jan 15
2017-11-24 16:19:49	walter.scheirer	if i'm organizing it
2017-11-24 16:19:54	walter.scheirer	more travel next week...
2017-11-24 16:19:55	pbui	exactly, lack of time
2017-11-24 16:20:08	pbui	i think it is something the department needs to address though
2017-11-24 16:20:12	walter.scheirer	yeah
2017-11-24 16:20:13	walter.scheirer	agreed
2017-11-24 16:20:23	pbui	also, ucf looks legit
2017-11-24 16:20:57	walter.scheirer	maybe sometime this spring would be ideal
2017-11-24 16:20:59	walter.scheirer	for juniors
2017-11-24 16:21:07	pbui	yeah
2017-11-24 16:21:09	pbui	well
2017-11-24 16:21:16	pbui	for juniors it might be useful to tell them about REUs
2017-11-24 16:21:25	pbui	so earlier in the spring
2017-11-24 16:21:35	pbui	and give them guidance on how to apply for those
2017-11-24 16:21:40	pbui	as preparation for grad school
2017-11-24 16:22:05	walter.scheirer	yeah
2017-11-24 16:23:21	wtheisen	wait pbui if I️ don’t have to apply by fellowship deadline take it easy on the letters than omg
2017-11-24 16:23:33	wtheisen	my life just got so much easier holy guacamole
2017-11-24 16:25:13	pbui	well
2017-11-24 16:25:17	pbui	depends on the school
2017-11-24 16:25:24	pbui	what wording are you looking at
2017-11-24 16:25:49	pbui	if you are talking about like external fellowships like nsf, then yeah dont worry
2017-11-24 16:26:01	pbui	but if it's like "fellowship at tosu", then u might need to worry
2017-11-24 16:26:17	pbui	for ND, they sort of map students to fellowships, so u dont really need to apply directly
2017-11-24 16:26:30	pbui	as far as i know (i dont do grad admissions, so i could be wrong)
2017-11-24 16:26:35	walter.scheirer	that's correct
2017-11-24 16:26:52	pbui	like i didnt apply for any fellowships and i ended up w/ a schmidt
2017-11-24 16:26:56	pbui	b/c nd mapped me to it

2017-11-24 16:28:46	wtheisen	it says “Deadline for fellowship consideration”
2017-11-24 16:30:24	pbui	id try hit that deadline
2017-11-24 16:30:31	pbui	again, diff schools may do it differently
2017-11-24 16:30:36	pbui	u dont have to worry about ND
2017-11-24 16:30:50	pbui	maybe ask the school for clarification
2017-11-24 16:32:54	wtheisen	okay, i️ hope that’s the case because the deadline for admission is wayyyy later
2017-11-24 16:33:20	walter.scheirer	it is
2017-11-24 16:35:25	pbui	when in doubt, ask the people in charge
2017-11-24 17:18:33	tweninger	@wtheisen - you're gonna wanna make the fellowship deadline
2017-11-24 17:18:51	tweninger	Otherwise chances of admissions drop dramatically.
2017-11-24 17:19:20	tweninger	Because Prof had to pay for you immediately, which is a non starter for many
2017-11-24 17:21:36	wtheisen	welp. that sucks
2017-11-24 17:21:44	wtheisen	I️ dunno if I️ can meet the OSU one
2017-11-24 17:22:35	tweninger	OSU?
2017-11-24 17:23:02	wtheisen	Ohio state
2017-11-24 17:23:23	tweninger	When is deadline?
2017-11-24 17:24:21	wtheisen	December 1st
2017-11-24 17:25:01	tweninger	Well that seems reasonable - you can do that.
2017-11-24 17:25:42	jeffrey	It is completely unreasonable! He has a fractal lab, a final project, and a statement of purpose due!
2017-11-24 17:27:20	tweninger	Yeah, I suppose you're right. Things really get easier when you get into grad school /s
2017-11-24 17:28:09	ccarball	+christmasrevolt
2017-11-24 17:28:42	jeffrey	I mean, I'm just hoping things are easier during the time period of "gotten in" and "actually start"
2017-11-24 17:29:30	wtheisen	the problem is there’s a 3-5 day period for transcripts to send, then a 3-5 day period before a notification gets sent to my recommenders
2017-11-24 17:29:39	wtheisen	10 days puts me over the edge
2017-11-24 17:30:31	walter.scheirer	still worth going for
2017-11-24 17:30:42	walter.scheirer	a lot of these deadlines have some slack behind the scenes
2017-11-24 17:34:18	tweninger	Oh. It's very unlikely that they care about the offical transcripts. Just submit your GPS printout or whatever we have at ND
2017-11-24 17:37:37	ewilli23	Chromebook commercial: “If you wish computers were more like phones...” I don’t think anyone’s wished that ever
2017-11-24 17:38:26	androidkitkat	That's called an iPad
2017-11-24 17:39:35	wtheisen	see notre dame allows unofficial but all the other schools say they want actual ones
2017-11-24 17:39:46	wtheisen	from all schools attended which means 3 for me
2017-11-24 17:40:45	jeffrey	3?!
2017-11-24 17:40:56	wtheisen	yeah
2017-11-24 17:41:44	wtheisen	24 credits from Bluffton, 3 from ONU then my actual college from ND
2017-11-24 17:46:36	jeffrey	I didn't know about the 3 OSU credits. Nice.
2017-11-24 17:53:17	wtheisen	ONU, lol ohio northern. I️ took physics with my dad
2017-11-24 17:58:49	jeffrey	Acronyms are hard
2017-11-24 18:06:37	pbui	wtheisen: h4x
2017-11-24 18:07:03	tweninger	You've got to provide your offical transcripts everywhere eventually, but your unofficial will be fine for application everywhere. Call to ask in case you're not sure.

2017-11-28 14:30:33	alitteke	@bdevorem I had an interview on hackerrank yesterday
2017-11-28 15:02:30	bdevorem	@alitteke tell me about it?
2017-11-28 15:04:06	ncarroll	how did the ND web hosting change again?
2017-11-28 15:04:29	ncarroll	Im trying to edit my website but I can't find where the old stuff went
2017-11-28 15:04:33	walter.scheirer	the first rule of ND web hosting is don't use ND web hosting
2017-11-28 15:04:35	alitteke	It was, fine? It was a C++ internship and there were some multiple choice questions that were more difficult than I expected them to be, both about the language and algorithms, and then the code questions were basically some of the medium to difficult questions that they have.
2017-11-28 15:05:13	alitteke	What was nice though was that they did make sure that you didn’t have to worry about what items to include, you just had to write in a self contained function and the compiler messages were messages you’d get from g++
2017-11-28 15:05:31	bdevorem	cool, so they made u code in c++?
2017-11-28 15:05:38	bdevorem	did you know that going into it?
2017-11-28 15:05:39	ncarroll	so dont make an ND website?
2017-11-28 15:05:46	walter.scheirer	i use external hosting
2017-11-28 15:05:49	walter.scheirer	for my academic website
2017-11-28 15:06:02	ncarroll	I just used ND for novelty stuff so far
2017-11-28 15:06:03	walter.scheirer	saves me a lot of trouble
2017-11-28 15:06:16	alitteke	Yes, the internship was specifically for C++ and I think the employer can set what languages they allow
2017-11-28 15:06:27	alitteke	I could’ve used c++ and c++14
2017-11-28 15:06:30	bdevorem	interesting
2017-11-28 15:06:31	alitteke	*or
2017-11-28 15:07:39	bdevorem	so did they tell you prior that it would be done in c++?
2017-11-28 15:08:34	bdevorem	the internship im looking at is for developing a certain language but they didnt list it as a requirement on the posting
2017-11-28 15:09:00	bdevorem	(i dont know that language)
2017-11-28 15:09:20	bdevorem	but they also listed c and python in the job posting, but didnt say anything about the interview
2017-11-28 15:09:37	alitteke	They did tell me prior
2017-11-28 15:09:53	alitteke	Well, no they didn’t
2017-11-28 15:10:01	walter.scheirer	isn't it kind of crazy if they don't specify the language ahead of time?
2017-11-28 15:10:06	alitteke	I just kind of assumed actually now that i’m looking at the email
2017-11-28 15:10:18	bdevorem	my hackerrank email said literally nothing
2017-11-28 15:10:23	walter.scheirer	"Surprise: the internship will be Ada development!"
2017-11-28 15:10:27	bdevorem	except i have 60 minutes
2017-11-28 15:10:37	bdevorem	i didnt know there would be mult choice
2017-11-28 15:10:58	alitteke	I think the employer can specify it as they see fit
2017-11-28 15:11:20	bdevorem	i guess we will see if i sink or swim
2017-11-28 15:11:41	walter.scheirer	it'd be a waste of everyone's time if there were continual mismatches between candidates and employers
2017-11-28 15:12:10	walter.scheirer	i'd question the competency of any company not putting the requirements up front
2017-11-28 15:12:51	bdevorem	good point
2017-11-28 15:13:11	bdevorem	well, im gonna practice on hackerrank before. i can do the interview whenever i want
2017-11-28 15:34:50	dchiang	@ncarroll i made a HOWTO that they said they were going to put somewhere but i don't know where

2017-11-28 16:25:22	jeffrey	@dchiang I wanted to put the how to on the blog but that was during the time the blog was non-existent
2017-11-28 16:34:20	jeffrey	Do we want to move the blog auto-build to appa? I'm not a fan of the 5+ minute build time from travis-ci.
2017-11-28 16:34:44	pbui	jeffrey: that would be cool
2017-11-28 16:34:52	pbui	also, did we settle on the meeting tomorrow?

2017-11-28 16:35:18	pbui	cool
2017-11-28 16:35:20	jeffrey	I don't know how to get the github hooks to shoot at appa though
2017-11-28 16:35:36	pbui	appa needs to listen somewhere
2017-11-28 16:35:39	jeffrey	the outside world doesn't see him
2017-11-28 16:35:45	pbui	ssh-tunnel
2017-11-28 16:35:58	pbui	reverse ssh-tunnel
2017-11-28 16:36:05	jeffrey	but like, at that point, why not have whatever we're tunneled to do the build
2017-11-28 16:36:07	pbui	or we can ask MD to put appa on the open internet

2017-11-28 18:27:02	ncarroll	@androidkitkat cheaper is better, but I'd be willing to pay for higher quality
2017-11-28 18:27:14	pbui	what is cheap
2017-11-28 18:27:16	ncarroll	but I don't need tons of processing

2017-11-28 22:40:48	bdevorem	@channel does anyone have their old OS myshell project that they'd be willing to send my way (for sCiEnCe)? Preferably someone who didn't plagiarize @jeffrey's solution... I'm doing some plagiarism detection work and need to run a base experiment with a non-plagiarized example. [cc: ccarball]
2017-11-28 22:41:45	jeffrey	did i plagiarize my solution?
2017-11-28 22:42:19	bdevorem	too philosophical, can't answer
2017-11-28 22:44:48	jbaker10	I have mine if you want
2017-11-28 22:45:01	jbaker10	My myshell was the bomb.con
2017-11-28 22:45:22	bdevorem	please!
2017-11-28 22:45:24	jbaker10	Wut
2017-11-28 22:45:29	jbaker10	It thinks that’s a website
2017-11-28 22:45:52	shuyang	I can send you mine, it’ll be a few hours tho
2017-11-28 22:46:48	bdevorem	great, the more the merrie
2017-11-28 22:46:54	bdevorem	*merrier
2017-11-28 22:59:14	dschmied	What if I don’t remember if I plagiarized jeffrey’s solution?
2017-11-28 22:59:30	bdevorem	sounds like a problem
2017-11-28 22:59:38	jeffrey	no one plagariaizzed my solution but me
2017-11-28 22:59:49	bdevorem	but i can add it to my experiments if you want to send it over @dschmied
2017-11-28 23:00:00	bdevorem	all I need is myshell.c
2017-11-28 23:00:05	bdevorem	I'll compile it myself
2017-11-28 23:02:26	dschmied	Honestly, I think mine wasn’t right. I lost a lot of points on it if it’s the one I think it is. I’ll send it after the movie though if I remember.
2017-11-28 23:02:36	bdevorem	ok
2017-11-28 23:08:06	wtheisen	@bdevorem I can send you mine tomorrow if you'd like
2017-11-28 23:35:36	jeffrey	How would arrays of strings work?
2017-11-28 23:39:40	nbrooks3	or arrays of arrays of chars
2017-11-28 23:42:04	nbrooks3	c master race
2017-11-29 00:01:41	jeffrey	but in cminor
2017-11-29 00:02:16	jeffrey	are they arrays of addresses of the strings?
2017-11-29 00:02:31	jeffrey	He said we only need arrays of integers, but I want all the arrays
2017-11-29 00:27:54	wtheisen	it'd have to just be an array of pointers
2017-11-29 00:28:28	wtheisen	unless you did something clever with the access to dynamically find the size of the string sin the array and access the right place and length

2017-11-29 12:54:43	dchiang	so he wanted to disambiguate himself
2017-11-29 13:22:24	walter.scheirer	Should I change my name to William so @ssjohns can identify me?

2017-11-29 18:52:58	jeffrey	Too young to appreciate what?
2017-11-29 19:07:44	walter.scheirer	Old school simpsons episodes, video cameras...

2017-11-29 19:10:58	jeffrey	The only good Simpson's episodes are old
2017-11-29 19:18:04	walter.scheirer	Truth
2017-11-29 19:18:20	walter.scheirer	Though some are rather dated at this point
2017-11-29 19:20:58	pbui	i havent seen the simpsons in over a decade
2017-11-29 19:21:01	pbui	is it still going?
2017-11-29 19:21:40	jeffrey	Yes, the newest season started maybe a month ago.
2017-11-29 19:21:49	jeffrey	I watch the tree house of horror every year.
2017-11-29 19:22:25	jeffrey	But that's it. They're the only ones I watch, and they're not really worth watching anymore either.

2017-11-29 19:24:49	jeffrey	I think at its prime, the Simpsons was even better than futurama
2017-11-29 19:25:00	jbaker10	Blah blah I have a 100 bit simulator
2017-11-29 19:25:16	jbaker10	Ez pz
2017-11-29 19:25:17	pbui	is that a big deal?
2017-11-29 19:25:27	jbaker10	Yeah
2017-11-29 19:25:32	jbaker10	People are on the quest for 100
2017-11-29 19:25:42	pbui	y
2017-11-29 19:26:28	jbaker10	I can’t remember exactly why,  but I think it’s related to the threshold of number of qubits to threaten crypto
2017-11-29 19:28:19	pbui	oh, exciting
2017-11-29 19:56:15	walter.scheirer	Shor’s algorithm requires thousands of qbits to factor 2048 bit RSA
2017-11-29 19:57:15	walter.scheirer	Also, students who took security known an alternative algorithm for key exchange that is secure against quantum attacks
2017-11-29 19:57:21	walter.scheirer	;)

2017-11-29 20:14:22	pbui	@dchiang: ^ that is pretty cool
2017-11-29 21:43:39	dchiang	cool. uses cling
2017-11-29 21:44:00	pbui	i want to incorporate this somehow
2017-11-29 21:44:09	pbui	needs to think about it
2017-11-29 22:49:10	jeffrey	what if I get into 0 schools
2017-11-29 22:54:53	pbui	try again
2017-11-29 22:54:57	pbui	get a job
2017-11-29 22:56:28	jeffrey	I don't want a job
2017-11-29 22:56:42	ccarball	so get into a school
2017-11-29 22:57:28	jeffrey	rn I have 5 schools in mind. Should I open that up more?
2017-11-29 22:57:43	jeffrey	Of [5, 6, 7, 8] what number is the best?
2017-11-29 22:59:22	-->	jmazane1 (jmazane1@irc.tinyspeck.com) has joined #lug
2017-11-29 23:01:00	pbui	u should have a backup school
2017-11-29 23:01:34	jeffrey	I do have a backup school, but idk how low said school should be
2017-11-29 23:01:50	pbui	doesnt matter the ranking
2017-11-29 23:07:41	jeffrey	So is 6 enough to not cry?
2017-11-29 23:08:34	pbui	six schools?
2017-11-29 23:08:53	jeffrey	yes
2017-11-29 23:09:14	pbui	depends on the schools
2017-11-29 23:09:40	jeffrey	I originally had a list of like 6 but jbb told me to aim higher
2017-11-29 23:10:13	jeffrey	but aiming higher means that they'll say no and I'll be unemployed
2017-11-29 23:19:44	pbui	aim higher as in better schools?
2017-11-29 23:20:58	jeffrey	yes
2017-11-29 23:22:29	pbui	porque no los dos?
2017-11-29 23:23:16	jeffrey	And apply to 11?
2017-11-29 23:27:53	pbui	sure
2017-11-29 23:27:59	pbui	only costs u time and money
2017-11-29 23:28:22	jeffrey	How about 6?
2017-11-29 23:28:40	pbui	which one is six
2017-11-29 23:28:50	jeffrey	which one?
2017-11-29 23:28:58	pbui	six schools?
2017-11-29 23:29:01	pbui	or top six?
2017-11-29 23:29:03	jeffrey	ye
2017-11-29 23:29:09	pbui	six is good
2017-11-29 23:29:12	pbui	i applied to 4
2017-11-29 23:29:33	pbui	people always say more is better, but if u target the specific schools, u can get away w/ less
2017-11-29 23:29:35	pbui	i dunno
2017-11-29 23:30:18	jeffrey	I wish I had decided that I wanted to do this like, some time before this past summer.
2017-11-29 23:31:26	pbui	:|
2017-11-30 00:23:34	jeffrey	arrays are weird
2017-11-30 00:23:47	jeffrey	or rather, cminor doesn't have pointers, so arrays are hard
2017-11-30 00:24:02	jeffrey	at least if you want argv to work, which we don't have to, but I wanted it
2017-11-30 00:24:39	jeffrey	since all the other array names are just pointers to their first elements, so you just load the address of the array, then add 8*the index, and you win
2017-11-30 00:25:13	jeffrey	but array parameters have as their values the pointer to the first element
2017-11-30 02:29:53	jeffrey	poop
2017-11-30 02:30:21	jeffrey	my roommate walked in and typed that
2017-11-30 03:08:15	jeffrey	omg the bounce program compiles and runs

2017-11-30 13:40:43	tweninger	oh geez
2017-11-30 13:41:03	tweninger	the one day I decide to actually dedicate time to work on something - I get internet famous
2017-11-30 13:44:58	silv3r	39k upvotes
2017-11-30 13:45:00	silv3r	Not bad
2017-11-30 13:45:20	silv3r	I wonder how many of them read the article
2017-11-30 13:56:02	tweninger	10K I bet
2017-11-30 13:56:36	silv3r	Do you have the data?
2017-11-30 13:56:58	silv3r	Doing research on a thread about yourself doing research on threads. So meta
2017-11-30 13:58:16	tweninger	I do have the data
2017-11-30 13:58:37	tweninger	but the data they reference is not the data they reference in the article
2017-11-30 14:21:28	ewilli23	> According to a paper published in IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems by researchers at Notre Dame University
2017-11-30 14:21:40	ewilli23	_Notre Dame University_

2017-11-30 15:14:12	androidkitkat	time to study

2017-11-30 15:19:31	walter.scheirer	nice
2017-11-30 15:19:46	ewilli23	I know it’s been mentioned in #lug before, but has anyone setup sshfs with the student machines, and if so how did you manage AFS auth?
2017-11-30 15:22:29	ewilli23	I’ve gotten it to work to the point that it mounts my afs space and I can read my files but I can’t write anything
2017-11-30 15:59:31	ewilli23	(it works if I don’t use ssh keys to log in, but I’d like to be able to use my key instead of entering my password every time)
2017-11-30 16:19:07	jeffrey	I think the best you can do is to request a 30 day AFS token, which for me lasts about 4 days
2017-11-30 16:22:07	ewilli23	Yeah I have my cshrc set to request a 30d token, which lasts me exactly 24h
2017-11-30 16:24:32	jeffrey	just store your password in a plaintext file and kinit and force it in every few minuts, ex
2017-11-30 16:24:33	jeffrey	ez
2017-11-30 16:25:20	pbui	make it a cronjob
2017-11-30 16:25:22	pbui	and then wall it
2017-11-30 16:25:43	jeffrey	wait, but guys, it actually reads the password from stdin
2017-11-30 16:26:42	jeffrey	`echo hi | kinit -r30d && aklog;` yields `kinit: Password incorrect while getting initial credentials`
2017-11-30 16:29:22	jeffrey	we aren't allowed to wall anymore
2017-11-30 16:32:18	pbui	http://blog.system76.com/post/168050597573/system76-me-firmware-updates-plan 
2017-11-30 16:43:44	androidkitkat	jeffery would be pleased
2017-11-30 16:49:10	bdevorem	@alitteke this is what the test is telling me before i begin : ```1.This is not a programming test
2017-11-30 16:49:10	bdevorem	2.You will also be asked about some of your previous coding experience
2017-11-30 16:49:10	bdevorem	3.To  understand more about the environment, time limits, etc. you can read the FAQ```
2017-11-30 16:49:20	bdevorem	does that mean *no* coding...?
2017-11-30 16:49:24	bdevorem	im confused
2017-11-30 16:49:30	bdevorem	and now im nervous to hit start
2017-11-30 16:51:35	bdevorem	if anyone has ideas, lemme know plz
2017-11-30 16:51:39	bdevorem	am stressed
2017-11-30 16:54:13	jeffrey	It sure looks like an experience interview
2017-11-30 16:54:19	jeffrey	like, what projects did you do
2017-11-30 16:54:36	bdevorem	ugh and i waited a month to do this bc i thought it was coding
2017-11-30 16:57:12	smike	@bdevorem why you interviewing?
2017-11-30 16:57:32	alitteke	That is not what mine said
2017-11-30 16:57:49	alitteke	It said: There will be 6 multiple choice questions and 3 coding questions
2017-11-30 16:57:58	bdevorem	i have to get a summer internship @smike
2017-11-30 16:58:03	bdevorem	emery is going on sabbatical
2017-11-30 16:58:07	smike	Omg come work here with me
2017-11-30 16:58:17	bdevorem	only if u let me live w u
2017-11-30 16:58:43	smike	I'll be moved out by then so if you enjoy couches sure
2017-11-30 16:59:09	bdevorem	this feels like a coding interview tho, bc before it says "not a programming test", there's a message from the company that says "we know this is daunting but show us your best"
2017-11-30 16:59:18	bdevorem	which makes it sound like a coding interview
2017-11-30 16:59:22	jeffrey	All interviews are daunting
2017-11-30 16:59:35	bdevorem	ugh
2017-11-30 16:59:45	smike	Which company?
2017-11-30 17:00:11	bdevorem	mozilla
2017-11-30 17:00:27	bdevorem	ok im just gonna jump in
2017-11-30 17:00:28	bdevorem	bye
2017-11-30 17:00:32	jeffrey	Glhf
2017-11-30 17:00:34	bdevorem	i might die but its fine
2017-11-30 17:01:22	smike	I believe in you
2017-11-30 17:01:42	pbui	bdevorem: u can do it!
2017-11-30 17:03:57	pbui	system76 thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15819093 
2017-11-30 17:08:49	smike	What's the significance of that?
2017-11-30 17:13:50	wtheisen	do you guys think I’d get caught breaking into an office? We’re having a debate about it
2017-11-30 17:14:15	walter.scheirer	@wtheisen: http://time.com/4768488/college-student-kentucky-ducts-steal-exam-papers/ 
2017-11-30 17:14:44	wtheisen	yeah that’s what @abrizius is citing
2017-11-30 17:15:43	wtheisen	I️ think I️ could do it though
2017-11-30 17:18:09	abrizius	Tbf what happens at UK may not be applicable to the rest of the world
2017-11-30 17:18:52	ewilli23	It depends, does the office run High Sierra?
2017-11-30 17:19:14	ewilli23	If it does you can just try the door a few times and it’ll let you in without a key
2017-11-30 17:19:57	walter.scheirer	maybe i have hidden surveillance cameras in my office...
2017-11-30 17:20:58	wtheisen	yeah but couldn’t you just use your phone flash to overload the light sensors?
2017-11-30 17:21:09	wtheisen	it’d blur your face for sure
2017-11-30 17:31:58	jeffrey	What if the camera has a filter for non-IR? Do flashlights produce enough IR to overload it then?
2017-11-30 17:32:57	wtheisen	I️ mean just wear a scarf. I️ imagine strobing a cellphone flash has to do something. that stuff is so bright
2017-11-30 17:44:53	ssjohns	Some of my code is in Github's cmark parser!
2017-11-30 17:45:01	ssjohns	Kind of, but it still counts.
2017-11-30 18:05:13	jeffrey	neat
2017-11-30 18:07:09	jeffrey	Does the OS know when a program has overflowed its stack? Like, could it give an error other than a segfault when you overflow?
2017-11-30 18:07:46	walter.scheirer	yes, there are many mechanisms like that out there
2017-11-30 18:08:21	jeffrey	Does linux keep at least one page between the stack and heap?
2017-11-30 18:08:51	walter.scheirer	good question
2017-11-30 18:09:09	wtheisen	isn’t smashing the stack overwriting into the stack from the heap?
2017-11-30 18:09:22	walter.scheirer	@wtheisen: no
2017-11-30 18:09:29	wtheisen	dang
2017-11-30 18:09:37	wtheisen	which way does that go?
2017-11-30 18:09:39	walter.scheirer	please review your notes from security
2017-11-30 18:09:40	walter.scheirer	:stuck_out_tongue:
2017-11-30 18:09:52	wtheisen	:stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
2017-11-30 18:10:08	walter.scheirer	i know in some OSes, there is a guard page between the stack and heap
2017-11-30 18:10:17	walter.scheirer	i think windows does that
2017-11-30 18:10:21	jeffrey	That seems like the easiest way to do it
2017-11-30 18:11:06	walter.scheirer	research reveals that linux also does this now
2017-11-30 18:11:12	jeffrey	then on a pagefault you can go "are they trying to grow the stack? Oh, they are. But they are growing it into the guard page. kill them."
2017-11-30 18:11:27	jeffrey	what did linux do before?
2017-11-30 18:11:41	walter.scheirer	it didn't do anything
2017-11-30 18:12:06	walter.scheirer	but this only prevents some attacks
2017-11-30 18:12:08	jeffrey	so your heap and stack could overlap?
2017-11-30 18:12:21	walter.scheirer	yep
2017-11-30 18:17:21	wtheisen	isn’t there some attack that takes advantage of that!?
2017-11-30 18:26:02	ssjohns	I think Ramzi mentioned a way to overwrite passwords and expected input using that freshman year or something.
2017-11-30 18:47:52	tweninger	Hey Shaq..  I was in frontage of Reddit today in /r/science. Where do I redeem my internet points for cash?
2017-11-30 18:48:11	tweninger	Do I mail in a screenshot? Or is there a form to fill out?
2017-11-30 18:59:31	pbui	@tweninger: do u wnat the money in dogecoin or reddit gold?
2017-11-30 19:00:32	tweninger	Real actual gold please. Or small unmarked, nonsequential bills.
2017-11-30 19:01:00	pbui	i dont think conde nast can afford that
2017-11-30 19:02:52	tweninger	Reddit mangers asked for my user name when they visited... I declined :)
2017-11-30 19:03:59	pbui	lol
2017-11-30 19:04:15	jeffrey	shoot, I went to write sbrk, but the OS doesn't set up the pages for the data segment of the program, so a program will pagefault, and then I go "aha, you are trying to grow the stack into the heap!" and i kill the process
2017-11-30 19:08:27	pbui	so mean
2017-11-30 19:08:33	pbui	what did the process ever do to u
2017-11-30 19:09:10	jeffrey	it didn't tell me where its data segment began and ended, so I didn't know where to set the break
2017-11-30 19:30:20	wtheisen	@tweninger why exactly do indexes speed up joins and selects? What intrinsic property of joins enables the boost?
2017-11-30 19:32:44	ssjohns	Lol, only we can redeem those points for monies. The advertisers pay us and we give you the fake internet points haha.
2017-11-30 19:33:14	ssjohns	:money_with_wings:
2017-11-30 19:39:04	cshinave	@wtheisen scanning
2017-11-30 19:40:31	cshinave	If you have index and you do a join, you can match foreign keys in O(1) time per item, i.e. O(n)
2017-11-30 19:40:42	cshinave	Assuming one foreign key per row
2017-11-30 19:41:02	cshinave	Without join you have to do full table scan per item
2017-11-30 19:41:06	cshinave	N^2
2017-11-30 19:41:56	cshinave	With selects it depends, a bare select is sped up by an index ( O(1) < O(n))
2017-11-30 19:43:01	cshinave	But if you add some filtering it can add a lot of speed up. I.e. Range queries or regex if you have index with given field sorted
2017-11-30 19:45:11	tweninger	@wtheisen joins require tuples to match on one or more columns. This can be an expensive process, if you can make the matching processes faster (with an index) then you can make the join faster.
2017-11-30 19:45:26	wtheisen	but how does an index make it faster?
2017-11-30 19:45:42	tweninger	it makes row-lookups (matches) faster
2017-11-30 19:45:55	wtheisen	is this just turtles all the way down?
2017-11-30 19:46:12	tweninger	if you are joining two tables you have to do a pairwise matching to join tuples together
2017-11-30 19:46:31	tweninger	that is potentially n^2 lookups
2017-11-30 19:47:15	tweninger	we've got to do this smartly... indexing makes this very very fast
2017-11-30 19:49:04	tweninger	afk for 30 minutes
2017-11-30 19:49:10	wtheisen	the basic idea behind an index is that it's like a unique hash right?
2017-11-30 19:49:17	wtheisen	so lookups are speedy?
2017-11-30 19:49:17	tweninger	putting son to bed
2017-11-30 19:49:24	tweninger	yeah thats one way to think of it
2017-11-30 20:15:12	8bit	bdevorem: did it go alright?  Was it coding?
2017-11-30 20:34:12	pbui	y did i get a h4x-mas email from cse club but not lug

2017-11-30 21:51:43	jbaker10	how hard could it be to teach C++?
2017-11-30 21:53:12	jbaker10	better yet let me teach python. I'm a pro
2017-11-30 21:55:26	jbaker10	but actually I would do that as a senior project....just get a faculty adviser. seems good
2017-11-30 21:55:39	pbui	would be cool
2017-11-30 22:03:52	pbui	hmm, i didnt see this posted: https://engineering.nd.edu/news-publications/engineering-newswire/emu-technology-completes-5m-series-a-2-funding-round 
2017-11-30 22:39:53	jeffrey	I was browsing Reddit and saw some post saying that most people upvote without reading, so I said "I'll show you!", downvoted without reading, and kept scrolling.
2017-11-30 22:40:51	pbui	~ edgy ~
2017-11-30 22:42:52	jeffrey	I think every comment should have a default karma score of -5. That way I don't have to downvote people as much.
2017-11-30 22:46:48	tweninger	That post is now the second highest post in /r/science ever.
2017-11-30 22:46:48	tweninger	I still can't wait to cash in my internet points.
2017-11-30 22:49:38	8bit	How does it feel to be a legend?
2017-11-30 22:52:20	jeffrey	huh, so it is
2017-11-30 22:54:16	tweninger	So.. many.. emails..
2017-11-30 22:54:16	silv3r	Only 30k more to go
2017-11-30 22:54:20	silv3r	LOL
2017-11-30 22:54:31	silv3r	you should do an ama
2017-11-30 22:55:03	jeffrey	"I caused brexit by accident, for science, AMA!"
2017-11-30 22:55:55	tweninger	"I am wholly and completely responsible for fake news, ama"
2017-11-30 22:56:37	jeffrey	In the hallway I was told you cited a fake "Prof. Wim Teninger", is this true?
2017-11-30 22:57:16	tweninger	Look for new articles in gizmodo and guardian and others in coming days
2017-11-30 22:58:02	tweninger	@jeffrey it was "Aspen lunde"
2017-11-30 22:58:24	tweninger	Esteemed Prof at a fake University in Belgium
2017-11-30 22:58:50	silv3r	Inb4 those upvotes were caused by the Reddit shill army @tweninger has been creating under the guise of ‘research’
2017-11-30 22:59:03	tweninger	For science!
2017-11-30 22:59:50	8bit	tweninger: do you downvote my memes for science?  is that why reddit always rejects my memes?
2017-11-30 23:00:21	silv3r	‘I just got a multi million dollar grant from the Russi..er US government!’
2017-11-30 23:00:27	--	degdeg is now known as alunde
2017-11-30 23:00:43	tweninger	Don't feel bad... On average the same image is posted 8 times before it becomes popular
2017-11-30 23:01:16	alunde	Greetings from the famous fake University in Belgium
2017-11-30 23:01:51	tweninger	Tell me Prof lunde... What are your thoughts on brexit?
2017-11-30 23:02:39	tweninger	(how'd you so that? Whomever you are)
2017-11-30 23:04:16	silv3r	bork
2017-11-30 23:04:35	silv3r	> theory was proven wrong
2017-11-30 23:04:44	jeffrey	bork
2017-11-30 23:04:47	jeffrey	huh
2017-11-30 23:05:04	jeffrey	oh, duh
2017-11-30 23:06:07	jeffrey	bork
2017-11-30 23:06:07	alunde	bork bork
2017-11-30 23:06:37	8bit	So science guarantees upboats if I spampost the same image 8 times in a row?  cool cool.
2017-11-30 23:06:38	jeffrey	since his name is alunde and not degdeg the bot disconnected
2017-11-30 23:07:02	tweninger	On average*
2017-11-30 23:07:27	tweninger	Also, you can raise your odds if you use titles with certain keywords.
2017-11-30 23:07:28	silv3r	Ahh
2017-11-30 23:07:43	silv3r	U should sell those keywords
2017-11-30 23:07:56	tweninger	The one we found has the latest effect in /r/pics is "murica"
2017-11-30 23:08:47	8bit	s/sell/give us/
2017-11-30 23:10:42	pbui	Lots of [removed] in the r/science thread
2017-11-30 23:10:48	silv3r	Nice try @8bit
2017-11-30 23:12:24	8bit	pbui: that's pretty common to any popular r/science thread
2017-11-30 23:12:38	8bit	really any popular thread in any sub with uncommon rules on commenting
2017-11-30 23:14:05	pbui	I don't visit r/science normally
2017-11-30 23:18:50	ewilli23	If an exception is thrown inside a try block, does the rest of the block execute?
2017-11-30 23:18:52	tweninger	I don't either.. I learned about it from lug
2017-11-30 23:19:07	ewilli23	Or does it proceed immediately to the catch block
2017-11-30 23:19:22	pbui	It goes to the catch
2017-11-30 23:19:29	tweninger	Ethan, depends on language, but almost always goes directly to catch
2017-11-30 23:19:52	ewilli23	C++
2017-11-30 23:19:56	ewilli23	That’s what I thought
2017-12-01 00:50:30	jeffrey	Changing a struct in a header file and not recompiling all of the source files that used it breaks things, right?
2017-12-01 00:51:10	jeffrey	Or at least it can? I just had a very "Everything broke, but when I `make -B`ed everything fixed itself after changing nothing" moment
2017-12-01 00:52:41	ewilli23	Pretty sure
2017-12-01 00:52:59	ewilli23	If you link those un-recompiled binaries into a newly compiled program which includes the new header
2017-12-01 00:53:13	ewilli23	B/c then the header and the compiled library wouldn’t match
2017-12-01 08:44:56	androidkitkat	@jeffrey i owe you a cable
2017-12-01 09:00:23	androidkitkat	@ssjohns is it now required to have an email for an account?
2017-12-01 09:00:47	androidkitkat	you dont, but it very much appears that you do
2017-12-01 10:18:50	wtheisen	“this test won’t be nearly as time-sensitive” - tweninger lol
2017-12-01 10:18:55	wtheisen	RIP
2017-12-01 10:30:18	bdevorem	@8bit went well, no coding. Just asked about past experience
2017-12-01 13:35:31	jeffrey	Fam, does anyone know how to force `ld` to put the .data segment into the output file? I compile to a flat binary rather than an ELF file, but global data doesn't seem to get put into the file.
2017-12-01 19:41:12	pbui	@alitteke: https://www.wired.com/story/macos-update-undoes-apple-root-bug-patch/ 
2017-12-01 19:58:52	mflanag6	doh
2017-12-01 19:59:34	ewilli23	“the shoddiness of Apple’s patch joins a disturbing pattern of security missteps in High Sierra’s code.”
2017-12-01 19:59:52	ewilli23	"“Anyone rushing a patch like this could very easily make a mistake,” Reed says. “But the big question going around now is, what is Apple’s quality assurance [team] for Mac doing? I don’t know what’s going on that these bugs could have slipped past.“”
2017-12-01 20:00:25	pbui	what's QA?
2017-12-01 20:00:30	pbui	if it compiles, ship it
2017-12-01 20:52:03	jbaker10	Who compiles anymore. So 1999
2017-12-01 21:33:43	pbui	Board games are back, thanks to lessons designers learned from computer games - https://www.1843magazine.com/features/tabletop-generals 
2017-12-01 22:00:50	wtheisen	I have carcassonne and dominion if someone wants to try them?
2017-12-01 23:57:29	wtheisen	@jeffrey how do we actually compile the file that the compiler outputs?
2017-12-02 00:03:13	jeffrey	`gcc good1.s library.c` will make an a.out
2017-12-02 00:03:21	wtheisen	danke
2017-12-02 00:04:07	wtheisen	where is this library.c
2017-12-02 00:04:47	jeffrey	it's part of the starter code
2017-12-02 00:04:51	wtheisen	danke
2017-12-02 00:07:21	wtheisen	oh my god it worked
2017-12-02 00:07:38	jeffrey	nice
2017-12-02 00:07:51	wtheisen	is this how dthain feels all the time?
2017-12-02 00:08:24	jeffrey	like what?
2017-12-02 00:08:31	wtheisen	like, successful
2017-12-02 00:08:33	wtheisen	and stuff
2017-12-02 02:49:41	jeffrey	If for two semesters I did "data acquisition" for the CVRL (I just took pictures with a few  fancy 3D cameras), do I list that on my CV for "research experience"?
2017-12-02 07:39:10	flynn	Speaking as the director of that project: yes, but you may want to nuance it by calling it "research support" or "research aide" and be prepared to field questions about the nature of the work.
2017-12-02 12:41:14	pbui	i feel like @tweninger, i was all under my sink unclogging tubes
2017-12-02 12:41:20	pbui	i feel so handy
2017-12-02 12:41:29	pbui	didnt fix anything, but at least the sink doesnt leak...
2017-12-02 12:46:18	bdevorem	@pbui so emery just told me and his other 2 students that if the tax bill passes (with the laws that affect grad students), he "will work to compensate for this tax bullsh*t"
2017-12-02 12:46:38	pbui	well the senate version doesnt have the grad student stuff
2017-12-02 12:46:41	pbui	but the house does
2017-12-02 12:46:47	pbui	so it depends on what happens during reconciliation
2017-12-02 12:47:10	pbui	either way, it's no bueno though
2017-12-02 12:47:34	bdevorem	Right
2017-12-02 12:48:57	wtheisen	just be rich how hard is it!? lol RIP
2017-12-02 13:22:52	walter.scheirer	there's a simple fix: school just need to reclassify tuition waivers as scholarships
2017-12-02 13:24:38	pbui	simple for us
2017-12-02 13:24:43	pbui	not so simple for public schools
2017-12-02 13:25:01	walter.scheirer	we don't need to fix it: we're already safe
2017-12-02 13:25:20	walter.scheirer	endowment tax though
2017-12-02 13:25:45	walter.scheirer	not happy that seems to have survived in the current bills
2017-12-02 16:15:08	ewilli23	@bdevorem just buy fewer iPhones

2017-12-02 16:31:53	ewilli23	I’m sure a school like ND would *never* do anything like that
2017-12-02 16:32:11	walter.scheirer	our business school isn't in that league
2017-12-02 16:32:13	walter.scheirer	sadly
2017-12-02 16:32:44	pbui	" It is need based, the needs of the university. The people who go into finance and make the most money contribute more to the University. "

2017-12-02 17:26:26	jeffrey	Thanks @flynn
2017-12-02 17:27:09	jbaker10	Lol @pbui python 2 was garbo
2017-12-02 17:27:29	jbaker10	Can you believe writing print without parentheses? Insulting
2017-12-02 17:27:43	pbui	u troll too much
2017-12-02 17:29:44	8bit	What we need is a compromise: only using one parenthesis.  `print "Hello world!")`
2017-12-02 17:30:05	pbui	im not sure i am willing to teach the controversy
2017-12-02 17:33:56	jeffrey	I switched to 3 when NLP started
2017-12-02 17:35:04	pbui	yeah, and diggums is using 3
2017-12-02 17:35:12	pbui	i might switch to align w/ everyone else
2017-12-02 17:35:18	pbui	is ready to conform
2017-12-02 17:35:30	pbui	i just dont want to port all my existing scripts...
2017-12-02 17:35:32	pbui	sigh
2017-12-02 17:35:56	dchiang	it's not that hard to port
2017-12-02 17:36:07	dchiang	you can use six to help transition
2017-12-02 17:36:18	pbui	but i have a lot of random scripts
2017-12-02 17:36:58	pbui	step 1: install python3
2017-12-02 17:37:00	pbui	lol
2017-12-02 17:37:05	pbui	apparently didnt even have it installed
2017-12-02 17:47:04	pbui	also, a lot of my scripts do I/O, so there is a lot of string manipulation
2017-12-02 17:47:28	pbui	i just converted a script, and i had to add a few .decode('utf8')'s
2017-12-02 17:47:39	pbui	and im sure i missed some edge cases
2017-12-02 18:03:09	jeffrey	Wow, someone referenced the Reddit updoots paper in me_irl
2017-12-02 18:07:30	silv3r	So meta
2017-12-02 19:40:00	jeffrey	Do I include personal projects on my CV? What about internships?
2017-12-02 19:40:16	pbui	i would
2017-12-02 19:40:44	jeffrey	If I've only gotten one award during college, do I make a section for that?
2017-12-02 19:40:58	pbui	which award
2017-12-02 19:41:04	jeffrey	dean's list
2017-12-02 19:41:14	walter.scheirer	personal projects don't carry much weight with grad admissions committees
2017-12-02 19:41:14	pbui	u can put it under education
2017-12-02 19:41:15	walter.scheirer	sadly
2017-12-02 19:41:20	walter.scheirer	can't hurt to add
2017-12-02 19:41:26	jeffrey	ok
2017-12-02 19:41:33	walter.scheirer	but i doubt many folks will look at that closely
2017-12-02 19:41:43	jeffrey	If i'm only in one club do i mention it
2017-12-02 19:42:00	pbui	yeah, u were an office
2017-12-02 19:42:04	pbui	officer*
2017-12-02 19:42:10	walter.scheirer	that probably counts more than your personal projects
2017-12-02 19:42:12	walter.scheirer	go figure
2017-12-02 19:42:17	pbui	i mean i dunno if people care, but i had it on there
2017-12-02 19:42:18	jeffrey	but then i need a category that just says "I was an office"
2017-12-02 19:42:36	pbui	group it under interests/hobbies?
2017-12-02 19:42:50	jeffrey	But then I need to know what my interests are
2017-12-02 19:42:54	walter.scheirer	put it under "leadership"
2017-12-02 19:43:10	jeffrey	Can I count it as "community outreach" and put it there?
2017-12-02 19:43:36	jeffrey	"I found this community of nerds and trolled them until they made me an officer"
2017-12-02 19:43:48	jeffrey	"I also married their leader"
2017-12-02 19:44:06	pbui	sounds like a coup
2017-12-02 19:49:04	jeffrey	Do people put gpas on these things? or grades for "relevant coursework"?
2017-12-02 19:53:31	walter.scheirer	no: that's what your transcript is for
2017-12-02 19:53:43	jeffrey	makes sense

2017-12-03 22:18:32	wtheisen	why are opening lines so hard
2017-12-03 22:19:18	pbui	how about "YO DAWG I HEARD YOU LIKED VECTORS, SO WHY DONT YOU PUT A VECTOR BILL IN YOUR LABS SO YOU CAN VECTOR WHILE YOU VECTOR"
2017-12-03 22:20:47	wtheisen	but then you can't use that to open your letter!

2017-12-03 22:56:13	jbaker10	Bui would just say it's "too cutesy" anyway
2017-12-03 22:56:57	ccarball	jbaker10: "i liek compooters. hire me. love, baker" 
2017-12-03 23:06:34	jbaker10	"but first. could you please tell me what exactly a computer is"
2017-12-03 23:27:42	jeffrey	"I'm just copying Breezy, hire me"
2017-12-03 23:37:53	jeffrey	Sidenote, I miss old medicine bottles and I miss old film containers. They were useful.
2017-12-04 00:17:40	jbaker10	sidenote what's in the box
2017-12-04 01:34:17	ewilli23	WHAT’S IN THE BOX???????
2017-12-04 01:35:12	jbaker10	thank you for understanding
2017-12-04 01:35:20	jbaker10	that movie is :fire:
2017-12-04 01:43:43	ewilli23	Never seen it
2017-12-04 02:11:43	jbaker10	now I'm just hurt
2017-12-04 02:41:42	jeffrey	I got it too but have also never seen it, just to hurt you more
2017-12-04 02:42:36	jeffrey	Breezy's personal statement is way better than mine, she did like twice the TAing and twice the research I did. How am I supposed to compete?
2017-12-04 03:53:03	jbaker10	I think her's was too long tbh
2017-12-04 08:37:45	pbui	ignore the language, look at the learn resources: http://programming-motherfucker.com/become.html

2017-12-04 10:08:15	wtheisen	anyone else here apply to the budapest reu for the summer?
2017-12-04 10:08:35	pbui	i think lferrara did it last year
2017-12-04 10:09:15	wtheisen	i️ just want people to take back their apps so i️ get it :yum:
2017-12-04 10:40:54	jeffrey	+1
2017-12-04 10:41:06	jeffrey	Wait can I do a REU over the summer? Is that allowed?
2017-12-04 10:43:42	bdevorem	I just went to my first emery talk and wow, he's good
2017-12-04 10:50:35	jeffrey	what was his talk about @bdevorem
2017-12-04 10:52:02	jeffrey	@a3qz i think today would be a good day to revolt against compilers, should I post it or will you?
2017-12-04 10:58:48	alitteke	I don’t know if the revolt can come from someone who isn’t in the class
2017-12-04 11:00:00	jeffrey	But he's on the piazza
2017-12-04 11:05:56	a3qz	I will do it if you provide the info
2017-12-04 11:07:36	jeffrey	I honestly think just copy pasting the original message would be the best outcome
2017-12-04 11:30:59	jbaker10	Copy pasta is the best
2017-12-04 12:32:58	wtheisen	compilers is so cool
2017-12-04 12:37:34	wtheisen	also very hard RIP
2017-12-04 12:49:00	jeffrey	I died laughing at the copy pasta but his reaction was underwhelming
2017-12-04 12:49:15	pbui	?
2017-12-04 12:49:38	jeffrey	@jeffrey uploaded a file: Screenshot_20171204-124929.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0L54J0MD/F88NTJSKS/screenshot_20171204-124929.jpg

2017-12-04 12:52:56	pbui	he's not wrong
2017-12-04 12:53:44	jeffrey	He isn't wrong in that he may think it was posted in the wrong place, but it was posted their intentionally
2017-12-04 12:53:57	jeffrey	There*
2017-12-04 12:54:04	pbui	he probably doesnt know the history
2017-12-04 12:54:55	jbaker10	@jeffrey your meme game is strong
2017-12-04 12:55:35	jeffrey	A3qz posted it
2017-12-04 12:56:35	jeffrey	Lol someone posted it again in the follow up section
2017-12-04 12:57:03	jeffrey	Do I post the EA copypasta?
2017-12-04 13:02:42	wtheisen	dthain must not be dank
2017-12-04 13:03:07	jeffrey	Can someone post one of those "you posted in the wrong X" videos ?
2017-12-04 13:12:10	a3qz	anyone else play the google doodle today and be frustrated that it doesnt acknowldege when you solve it in less steps than their "shortest solution"

2017-12-04 13:44:34	pbui	I have a mutiny in #cse-30341-fa17
2017-12-04 13:44:48	pbui	This is your fault @jeffrey
2017-12-04 13:45:29	jeffrey	I'm so happy
2017-12-04 13:46:02	jcioffi	So I just became active online again. Yknow, casually checking my emails
2017-12-04 13:46:07	jcioffi	when all of a sudden
2017-12-04 13:46:13	jcioffi	I saw the revolt
2017-12-04 13:46:25	jcioffi	@jeffrey @a3qz what on earth did you do
2017-12-04 13:47:16	silv3r	How much money if I copy pasta that into piazza
2017-12-04 13:47:31	8bit	only pride
2017-12-04 13:47:41	jeffrey	I mean, I could buy you a taco if you want
2017-12-04 13:49:00	jcioffi	also jack?
2017-12-04 13:49:08	jcioffi	how long have I been offline o.o
2017-12-04 13:49:09	jeffrey	Personally I'm just afraid Prof. Thain will think I was laughing in class over the impending copy pasta instead of me just enjoying the lecture
2017-12-04 13:49:36	jcioffi	I see the original comments are making a comeback
2017-12-04 13:49:43	8bit	can someone yld.me  the copy pasta?  I can't copy from weechat easily
2017-12-04 13:50:19	jcioffi	is it going to spread everywhere
2017-12-04 13:50:32	jcioffi	terrifying
2017-12-04 13:50:37	8bit	I'm considering printing it in many fonts
2017-12-04 13:50:42	jcioffi	oh my god
2017-12-04 13:52:02	8bit	a comic sans version, a calligraphy pro version, a papyrus version
2017-12-04 13:53:02	jcioffi	I have no words
2017-12-04 13:53:18	jcioffi	The Christmas revolt strikes again
2017-12-04 13:54:43	8bit	but now with at least one more level of irony
2017-12-04 14:24:20	jeffrey	Someone on HN referred to Chrome as "normal chrome" when someone mentioned Chromium #triggered

2017-12-04 16:48:02	pbui	that's what jay just told me
2017-12-04 16:52:58	jeffrey	I think I might do that, or at least apply
2017-12-04 16:53:32	8bit	I wanna take compilers really bad
2017-12-04 16:53:40	8bit	It sounds so so cool.
2017-12-04 17:01:40	wtheisen	it is

2017-12-04 17:47:50	pbui	@wtheisen: I see how it is
2017-12-04 17:48:00	wtheisen	systems is second
2017-12-04 17:48:09	pbui	deletes letter of recommendation
2017-12-04 17:48:20	wtheisen	please no
2017-12-04 17:50:31	pbui	The above implies I already wrote u one, which is obviously untrue

2017-12-04 18:21:09	jbaker10	It can just be a copy of someone else’s tbh
2017-12-04 18:25:19	pbui	i just wrote one today
2017-12-04 18:25:22	pbui	for ESTEEM
2017-12-04 18:25:25	pbui	u can use that one?
2017-12-04 18:27:23	jbaker10	Yup. Send that out for me
2017-12-04 18:28:49	pbui	do u have proof of an entrepeneural spirit?
2017-12-04 18:29:47	jbaker10	Have you met me? Duh
2017-12-04 19:21:16	wtheisen	@jeffrey how'd you evaluate the print statements? Left to right means that things in functions get printed out in the middle of the print statement
2017-12-04 19:21:37	wtheisen	Did you do a dry run first to find all the functions and push the returns onto the stack?
2017-12-04 19:21:46	wtheisen	keep track of how many functions were run
2017-12-04 19:23:04	jeffrey	I just do left to right
2017-12-04 19:23:32	wtheisen	but print "function return  value: ", func(), '\n'
2017-12-04 19:23:59	wtheisen	makes the prints in  func() happen in between the "function return value: " and the actual printed return value right?
2017-12-04 19:24:04	jeffrey	So?
2017-12-04 19:24:32	wtheisen	I mean that's not ideal behavior right?
2017-12-04 19:24:39	jeffrey	I feel like that is the most expected behavior though
2017-12-04 19:24:58	wtheisen	Okay, so that's probably above and beyond what we need to do then?
2017-12-04 19:25:05	wtheisen	because it'd be really annoying
2017-12-04 19:25:18	wtheisen	suppose I could ask on piazz
2017-12-04 19:25:21	jeffrey	yeah
2017-12-04 19:27:05	pbui	he might not respond after ur trolling
2017-12-04 19:27:58	jeffrey	then we rebel for real
2017-12-04 19:30:16	jeffrey	I mean, python just does it left to right
2017-12-04 19:30:33	wtheisen	I dunno, just seems wrong
2017-12-04 19:30:44	jeffrey	I feel like the programmer is wrong for doing that
2017-12-04 19:31:04	wtheisen	for trying to print the return value of a function!?
2017-12-04 19:31:20	jeffrey	for printing the return value of a function that prints
2017-12-04 19:32:23	pbui	wtheisen: that is normal evaluation order, left to right
2017-12-04 19:32:26	pbui	im not sure what else u should do
2017-12-04 19:32:36	pbui	if func() also prints, then yes, the flow is interuppted
2017-12-04 19:32:41	pbui	but that's how all languages do it
2017-12-04 19:32:49	pbui	that's y print is considered a side-effect
2017-12-04 19:35:03	wtheisen	ugh that just seems so wrong
2017-12-04 19:35:15	pbui	why
2017-12-04 19:35:53	wtheisen	I dunno, it seems like functions in print statements should be  evaluated before the final print happens
2017-12-04 19:36:01	wtheisen	the functions can  be parsed left to  right
2017-12-04 19:36:10	wtheisen	but prior to the print in which they're callled
2017-12-04 19:36:38	wtheisen	guess I'm used to printf("%d\n", meow(34)); which would evaluate the function first
2017-12-04 19:36:40	wtheisen	right?
2017-12-04 19:37:10	pbui	it gets evaluated and passed to the printf function
2017-12-04 19:37:15	wtheisen	right
2017-12-04 19:37:39	wtheisen	so in my mind >>>print "return val: ", meow(34), '\n';
2017-12-04 19:37:45	wtheisen	should be parsed the same way
2017-12-04 19:37:52	pbui	but u didnt do any formatting
2017-12-04 19:38:12	wtheisen	yeah I guess
2017-12-04 19:38:13	pbui	if u did printf("a"); printf("b");
2017-12-04 19:38:17	pbui	u get the same thing
2017-12-04 19:38:25	wtheisen	I suppose
2017-12-04 19:38:36	wtheisen	I still don't like it
2017-12-04 19:39:54	pbui	it's logical though
2017-12-04 19:39:56	pbui	and consistent

2017-12-04 19:59:18	alitteke	But Ireland is rejecting the ruling too? Why wouldn’t they want the 15 billion?
2017-12-04 20:03:19	jeffrey	my high school football team is going to its 5th state championship in 7 years, having won it 4 of the last 6 years. And I guess the eagles are doing ok, so it's fine that ND disappointed me.
2017-12-04 20:03:56	walter.scheirer	@jeffrey: where in PA are you from?
2017-12-04 20:04:07	pbui	alitteke: i think 1. the principle of who makes the law (national sovereignty vs EU), 2. they want to be business friendly
2017-12-04 20:04:24	pbui	if they are forced into being business unfriendly companies would leave
2017-12-04 20:04:26	pbui	probably
2017-12-04 20:04:45	pbui	jeffrey: my high school won a state championship
2017-12-04 20:04:53	jeffrey	I'm from Horsham, and my high school is in Warminster

2017-12-04 20:09:57	jeffrey	my hs coach put the "Play like a champion today" poster everywhere
2017-12-04 20:12:33	pbui	infringement
2017-12-04 20:12:45	pbui	u wouldnt download a football would u?
2017-12-04 20:13:05	walter.scheirer	the victory march must be out of copyright
2017-12-04 20:13:07	jeffrey	does streaming an nd football game count as downloading a football
2017-12-04 20:14:18	jeffrey	"The words and music which begin with the words "Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame" are in the public domain in the United States, but are protected in all territories outside of the country."
2017-12-04 20:15:10	jeffrey	But the first verse, which begins "Rally sons of Notre Dame" is still under copyright.
2017-12-04 20:15:46	walter.scheirer	lol
2017-12-04 20:20:34	wtheisen	@alitteke were you getting that floating point exception when you were doing his bounce.cminor program?
2017-12-04 20:21:07	alitteke	No, it was when I was trying to divide a negative number
2017-12-04 20:21:23	wtheisen	shucks
2017-12-04 20:21:38	wtheisen	what was the fix to that?
2017-12-04 20:21:56	wtheisen	Also did the bounce work for you then ?
2017-12-04 20:22:28	alitteke	I have other register issues passing between functions that’s keeping bounce from working for me right now
2017-12-04 20:22:34	wtheisen	ahh fair enough
2017-12-04 20:22:47	wtheisen	that stuff is *NOT* easy
2017-12-04 20:23:45	alitteke	no, and it works for one argument for me and I’m just freeing a register too early somewhere I think
2017-12-04 20:25:31	wtheisen	Wait so what was the fix for the floating (core dump) then?
2017-12-04 20:25:35	wtheisen	I don't remmember
2017-12-04 20:26:16	wtheisen	can you just do normal division and then negative the result?
2017-12-04 20:27:07	alitteke	I was using the wrong x86 command
2017-12-04 20:27:24	wtheisen	idivq?
2017-12-04 20:27:31	alitteke	CDQ or whatever it is
2017-12-04 20:27:39	wtheisen	oh im using cdq
2017-12-04 20:27:42	alitteke	I was using the less expansive one
2017-12-04 20:27:43	wtheisen	is that bad?
2017-12-04 20:28:27	alitteke	I think it is cqo
2017-12-04 20:28:33	alitteke	the one you want to use
2017-12-04 20:28:36	wtheisen	gotcha
2017-12-04 20:30:26	wtheisen	nice it worked, thanks much
2017-12-04 20:31:01	jeffrey	it seems strange that it is a floating point exception to extend bits when there are already high bits set
2017-12-04 20:39:41	wtheisen	@jeffrey have you gotten the bounce program to  work?
2017-12-04 20:40:01	wtheisen	Mine isn't displaying correctlly but I think it might be tied to  my monitor resolution being high
2017-12-04 20:40:45	jeffrey	yes
2017-12-04 20:41:14	wtheisen	hmmm okay, I'll have to test it on the monitor in my room then

2017-12-04 20:51:11	walter.scheirer	compilers was required in my undergraduate program
2017-12-04 20:51:19	walter.scheirer	it was a final semester senior year course
2017-12-04 20:51:34	walter.scheirer	you can image the enthusiasm
2017-12-04 20:51:50	pbui	i high recommend it, but i dont think it would go over well
2017-12-04 20:52:17	jeffrey	are varidic arguments passed differently than regular arguments?
2017-12-04 20:52:30	walter.scheirer	the trouble was that we had a PL course, which covered all of the basics
2017-12-04 20:52:33	pbui	do they use like va_list or soemthing
2017-12-04 20:52:38	wtheisen	just saw a girl working on the fractals assignment
2017-12-04 20:52:51	jeffrey	isn't the va_list in the function itself though?
2017-12-04 20:52:58	pbui	oh, i dunno
2017-12-04 20:52:59	walter.scheirer	so the compilers course ending up delving into optimizations that are now long forgotten
2017-12-04 20:53:07	jeffrey	because I can't get sprintf to work
2017-12-04 20:53:11	pbui	walter.scheirer: ah, less exciting
2017-12-04 20:53:37	pbui	wtheisen: some people took the OS post seriously... i have a mini revolt now
2017-12-04 20:53:48	pbui	this is why we cant have nice memes
2017-12-04 20:54:02	wtheisen	that meme is so incredibly dank
2017-12-04 20:55:31	walter.scheirer	i think lehigh has since eliminated the compilers course
2017-12-04 20:55:41	pbui	unfortunate
2017-12-04 20:56:13	walter.scheirer	i could see a sequence like: 1. PL introducing the fundamentals of compilers
2017-12-04 20:56:17	walter.scheirer	2. parallel compilers
2017-12-04 20:56:50	ccarball	wait, im not in compilers.. what am i doing here?
2017-12-04 20:57:07	silv3r	^
2017-12-04 20:57:41	jeffrey	you gotta store the number of SSE registers used for variadic calls in %RAX
2017-12-04 20:57:45	jeffrey	that was my problem
2017-12-04 20:57:59	pbui	fancy
2017-12-04 20:58:04	pbui	code gen sounds fancy
2017-12-04 20:58:16	jeffrey	I mean, we're not supposed to be doing that stuff
2017-12-04 20:58:32	jeffrey	I just wanted to know why sprintf worked when strcpy and malloc did
2017-12-04 20:58:51	walter.scheirer	i remember the days when compilers wouldn't generate mmx or sse code
2017-12-04 20:59:03	catvajiac	ccarball: take compilers with me next year? [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-04 20:59:35	wtheisen	@jeffrey how do you have to time to do all this extra stuff man
2017-12-04 20:59:44	ccarball	catvajiac: of course
2017-12-04 20:59:47	catvajiac	wewt
2017-12-04 20:59:51	pbui	wtheisen: he's efficient
2017-12-04 21:01:01	jeffrey	I don't @wtheisen, I'm just too scared to write my NYU statement of purpose
2017-12-04 21:01:34	jeffrey	also I got sprintf to work by writing a function called `dumb_work_around` that just returns 0, since that will set %rax to 0.
2017-12-04 21:02:24	jeffrey	If I submit that as a test case will dthain just be like, why did you do this, why
2017-12-04 21:04:19	pbui	sounds ingenius to me
2017-12-04 21:12:57	flynn	The compiler course sequence was a full year at MSU. Lexical analysis in fall, parsing/code generation in winter, and optimization for 10 weeks in spring.  Target hardware was a 60-bit CDC machine that used 1's complement arithmetic.
2017-12-04 21:13:11	walter.scheirer	intense
2017-12-04 21:13:13	catvajiac	woah

2017-12-04 21:14:35	walter.scheirer	what a bizarre word size
2017-12-04 21:15:19	flynn	15 and 30 bit opcodes (hardwire control)
2017-12-04 21:17:56	flynn	My textbook for the assembly language course (1st quarter junior year) and also used in 3rd quarter of compilers: http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/cdc/cyber/lang/compass/60492600G_COMPASS_Version_3_Reference_Manual_Jul1980.pdf 
2017-12-04 21:20:25	flynn	Love the coding form on page 2-3 - that was the style because often you WROTE your code before typing it into the card punch machine before loading your deck of cards in to the card reader before submitting your job to the batch system before picking up your printout several minutes later. And that, boys and girls, is how we debugged in the early age of silicon. One debugging iteration. Gah. Those who miss the old days can have them.
2017-12-04 21:20:51	walter.scheirer	i cut my teeth on the intel 8080, which was of that same era
2017-12-04 21:20:56	walter.scheirer	but a much simpler architecture
2017-12-04 21:21:11	flynn	8080 and 6502 were nice and clean
2017-12-04 21:21:14	walter.scheirer	though by the time i made it to college, we did everything in simulation
2017-12-04 21:21:23	walter.scheirer	i never got to actually use the 8080
2017-12-04 21:21:28	walter.scheirer	hehe

2017-12-05 00:05:44	androidkitkat	@jeffrey is the internet really safe
2017-12-05 00:06:38	jeffrey	no but my blog doesn't have anything unsafe
2017-12-05 00:28:17	jeffrey	ughhhhhhh my code for removing bad characters was wrong
2017-12-05 00:36:29	jeffrey	That means I gotta retrain, which I guess isn't so bad, an epoch doesn't take /that long
2017-12-05 00:37:13	jeffrey	Maybe 20 minutes per epoch on my gpu?

This includes x86 applications in the Store and, when upgraded to the full Windows 10 Pro, arbitrary desktop applications. Full details of the x86 emulator haven't been disclosed yet, with the performance in particular currently unknown, but we do know some broad elements of its design.
2017-12-05 14:45:21	pbui	wut
2017-12-05 14:46:33	wtheisen	that sounds horrific
2017-12-05 14:46:37	pbui	i sort of want one... w/ a trackpoint... and w/ linux
2017-12-05 14:46:41	pbui	fark intel
2017-12-05 14:46:43	pbui	via arm
2017-12-05 15:38:10	jeffrey	Microsoft was smart with that x86 emulator. And then Intel threatened to sue, and they laughed. At least that's what HN told me.
2017-12-05 17:35:55	pbui	Ugh, had to leave meeting to pick up caleb for dance rehearsal and jump wife's car
2017-12-05 17:36:13	pbui	Hopefully I didn't miss too much

2017-12-05 18:42:01	walter.scheirer	Yes, Haggar is still a go
2017-12-05 18:42:07	pbui	how certain
2017-12-05 18:42:22	walter.scheirer	Seems pretty certain
2017-12-05 18:42:42	pbui	cool

2017-12-05 18:51:05	walter.scheirer	we should add a cafe in the remodeling plan
2017-12-05 18:53:08	jbaker10	Yes cafe op
2017-12-05 18:53:25	pbui	not if it takes away from studio space
2017-12-05 18:53:29	jbaker10	Walter can I be your grad student? But can I just be left alone to do my own thing
2017-12-05 18:53:51	pbui	o/ me too
2017-12-05 18:54:15	jbaker10	Or Bui can I be yours?
2017-12-05 18:54:19	jbaker10	I can do systems
2017-12-05 18:54:44	jbaker10	You can leave me alone and I’ll do your grant apps etc
2017-12-05 18:55:38	wtheisen	why dont we get bond after the archis leave?
2017-12-05 18:55:52	wtheisen	The studios are already in there
2017-12-05 18:56:54	jbaker10	Bond isnt big enough
2017-12-05 18:57:07	wtheisen	It's as big as Haggar no?
2017-12-05 19:02:37	jbaker10	I didn’t think so
2017-12-05 19:03:02	silv3r	Where is Haggar
2017-12-05 19:03:04	silv3r	I want bond
2017-12-05 19:03:11	silv3r	It’s a 30 sec walk from my room
2017-12-05 19:05:16	jeffrey	Haggar is a 28 second walk from my room
2017-12-05 19:13:49	pbui	im actually ok w/ haggar now
2017-12-05 19:13:54	pbui	ive made peace w/ it
2017-12-05 19:15:15	dchiang	Someone else grabbed bond first
2017-12-05 19:15:29	dchiang	Maybe Hagar will be better after renovation
2017-12-05 19:15:53	dchiang	I wish the power plant would go away
2017-12-05 19:16:47	wtheisen	I heard it was?
2017-12-05 19:17:56	jbaker10	really? that would be odd
2017-12-05 19:19:19	jbaker10	how will we get power?!
2017-12-05 19:20:13	pbui	hamsters
2017-12-05 19:20:16	pbui	lots of them
2017-12-05 19:20:51	walter.scheirer	the original power plant was at the site of the current sculpture garden
2017-12-05 19:21:08	jbaker10	can we hire grad students for that?
2017-12-05 19:21:11	jbaker10	aka hire me
2017-12-05 19:25:04	pbui	nd would never hire their own
2017-12-05 19:25:10	pbui	it would be a huge mistake
2017-12-05 19:25:15	pbui	never good ever comes of it
2017-12-05 19:25:21	pbui	slinks away
2017-12-05 19:53:36	pbui	oh snap
2017-12-05 19:53:44	pbui	the mark closed on eddy street
2017-12-05 19:53:50	walter.scheirer	really?
2017-12-05 19:53:51	walter.scheirer	wow
2017-12-05 19:53:54	walter.scheirer	i didn't know that

2017-12-05 19:54:05	pbui	The Mark Dine & Tap, located at Eddy Street Commons near the University of Notre Dame, closed its doors Friday. Here is the post on its Facebook page:
2017-12-05 19:54:07	catvajiac	i dont think i ever went to the mark
2017-12-05 19:54:17	pbui	the original place in granger is better
2017-12-05 19:54:21	wtheisen	wow the mark closed
2017-12-05 19:54:47	walter.scheirer	that's surprising
2017-12-05 19:55:22	walter.scheirer	it was fairly popular
2017-12-05 19:55:25	pbui	oh it says right there, uptown kitchen
2017-12-05 19:55:32	pbui	i went there more often than the mark
2017-12-05 19:57:56	pbui	i wonder what would take its place
2017-12-05 19:58:00	walter.scheirer	one less place to take visitors and job candidates...
2017-12-05 19:58:04	walter.scheirer	good question
2017-12-05 20:34:43	dchiang	oh i thought the power plant had to be next to the lake for some reason. i do remember reading that nd was transitioning to renewable energy or something
2017-12-05 20:54:32	tweninger	I talked to the owner about the mark and uptown kitchen. He said the mark was only profitable in the fall
2017-12-05 20:59:40	walter.scheirer	the summer must be painful for the businesses around here
2017-12-05 20:59:54	walter.scheirer	the mark wasn't really student friendly
2017-12-05 20:59:58	walter.scheirer	which probably killed them in the spring
2017-12-05 21:04:47	jbaker10	I went exactly 2 times. Both on a gift card. It was alright but too expensive
2017-12-05 21:09:15	walter.scheirer	the food wasn't memorable, and the bar closed relatively early
2017-12-05 21:51:34	jeffrey	So I did random songs for my scanner test cases, Queen for my parser test cases, foo fighters and the killers for typechecker test cases, and now for code generation I think I will do parodies of songs
2017-12-05 21:51:59	jeffrey	I'm pretty proud of this one:```Professor Thain tries to mark us down
2017-12-05 21:51:59	jeffrey	(Talkin' about my code generation)
2017-12-05 21:51:59	jeffrey	Just because our typechecking isn't sound

2017-12-05 21:55:35	jeffrey	I did the whole first verse and refrain, but only the last line of the first verse isn't super cringey:```Codegen time...

2017-12-05 22:12:42	jeffrey	yes
2017-12-05 22:13:29	jeffrey	do i want to get string arrays and 2D arrays working? no, right? like, I should be working on trying to break my code generator in valid ways, not stupid for fun ways?

2017-12-06 15:59:46	wtheisen	I written exactly two bad CIF's in my time here, only one of which was really bad
2017-12-06 15:59:53	tweninger	basically, "dear prof, you're gonna get a bad cif from another student... dont listen to it"
2017-12-06 15:59:57	wtheisen	I try to be polite as possible
2017-12-06 15:59:59	walter.scheirer	why did you hate my class @wtheisen?

2017-12-06 21:18:39	jeffrey	but the internet says it was added in 2014

2017-12-06 21:38:12	pbui	i know, they would have had to google it
2017-12-06 21:38:24	walter.scheirer	they probably would have been like "well, this guy disappeared, guess we'll give the money to somebody else"
2017-12-06 21:38:37	pbui	or they could have awarded it to me

2017-12-06 21:49:20	dchiang	all my phone calls are from a robot who really wants to talk to me about health insurance
2017-12-06 22:07:39	walter.scheirer	ugh... robocalls
2017-12-06 22:08:08	walter.scheirer	my favorite one is that robot voice that tells me the IRS coming to arrest me
2017-12-06 22:08:22	jeffrey	I like the one where someone from the FBI has to talk to me
2017-12-06 22:08:24	pbui	oh man
2017-12-06 22:08:29	pbui	my wife gets the IRS one all the time
2017-12-06 22:09:25	walter.scheirer	it's one of the rare robocalls that leaves a voicemail
2017-12-06 22:10:52	jeffrey	my voicemail was full for 6  years from robocalls
2017-12-06 22:11:02	walter.scheirer	wow
2017-12-06 22:11:14	walter.scheirer	i get a lot of robocalls, but rarely do they leave messages
2017-12-06 22:11:39	jeffrey	I think it was just that freshman year of hs I got ~12 or so and then never deleted them
2017-12-06 22:11:49	jeffrey	until this summer

2017-12-06 22:57:30	pbui	Actually this would be a cool class..
2017-12-06 22:57:39	pbui	Papers we love
2017-12-07 01:37:42	jeffrey	Heads up to everyone in compilers - tricky test cases:```test(1, 2, 3, 20/4);
2017-12-07 01:37:42	jeffrey	```if you CQO it will modify %rdx, the third argument```test(10, fun(1));
2017-12-07 01:37:42	jeffrey	```when you call fun with argument 1 it might squash the 10 in %rdi

2017-12-07 01:44:28	jbaker10	@pbui a cool class would be a research seminar for undergrads. Give them a chance to read papers and give presentations about what they’re doing
2017-12-07 01:44:33	jbaker10	:thinking_face:
2017-12-07 01:58:42	jeffrey	My 11th cminor test case is `fractals.c`
2017-12-07 01:59:16	jeffrey	Except I removed fractals 3-8, because it is simply too much work
2017-12-07 02:00:59	jeffrey	(In reality, cminor doesn't support doubles, and for the last 6 I used cos and sin. I guess I could just do that part in C, but is that worth it?)
2017-12-07 02:01:49	jbaker10	@jeffrey do you just come on slack late at night to talk to yourself?
2017-12-07 02:02:24	jeffrey	yes
2017-12-07 02:02:34	jbaker10	carry on then sir
2017-12-07 02:02:39	jeffrey	no don't leave me

2017-12-07 02:02:50	jbaker10	we can be friends
2017-12-07 02:03:40	jeffrey	i need 6 more test cases
2017-12-07 02:04:01	jbaker10	did you already do everything from OS?
2017-12-07 02:04:19	jbaker10	make sure you have ctlr-c accounted for!
2017-12-07 02:04:47	jeffrey	no
2017-12-07 02:06:16	jbaker10	make a file system in c-minor
2017-12-07 02:06:18	jbaker10	oh wait

2017-12-07 02:31:37	jeffrey	good17.cminor is 200 print statements, each printing 250 characters of the bee movie script
2017-12-07 02:31:49	jbaker10	that movie....
2017-12-07 02:31:50	jbaker10	oof
2017-12-07 07:23:10	8bit	is 250 characters some sort of limit for strings?

2017-12-07 11:26:57	silv3r	That is one of the most CS things I’ve ever heard
2017-12-07 11:26:59	androidkitkat	steam got rid of the option
2017-12-07 11:27:00	flynn	Merchants won't take it because of volatility

2017-12-07 11:27:16	flynn	It was rather nasty
2017-12-07 11:27:20	androidkitkat	@silv3r use BTC to get that gtx 1080ti
2017-12-07 11:27:48	flynn	real soylent is smoother - this stuff (called Joylent then, JimmyJoy now) is gritty

2017-12-07 11:31:08	silv3r	While I know a recent email detailed about how using university resources to mine for coins is bad, I wonder if we could convince someone to setup a small mining rig ‘for science’
2017-12-07 11:32:18	androidkitkat	bui has a 980ti that we could use to mine
2017-12-07 11:32:18	silv3r	To learn about crypto mining n stuff
2017-12-07 11:32:22	8bit	mining hasnt been profitable except for farms for a while
2017-12-07 11:32:25	androidkitkat	for edu ofc

2017-12-07 12:31:11	flynn	Since it's a topic, I will note that there are a few Bitcoin/blockchainy "activities" getting underway at ND. I'm working with a couple of students on a blockchain/crypto club startup (there are two of them, actually; Prof. Madey is working with the other one) and we have some funds to support small research/course development/student project efforts. A request for proposals will go out early next semester. If anyone is curious or has thoughts on other potential activities, I will gladly receive thoughts.
2017-12-07 12:35:26	androidkitkat	theres a crypto club?
2017-12-07 12:35:32	androidkitkat	thats pretty cool
2017-12-07 12:36:00	flynn	just barely started, and cryptocurrency focus - no club programming yet
2017-12-07 12:36:22	androidkitkat	is it self funded
2017-12-07 12:36:32	androidkitkat	thatd be the best part
2017-12-07 12:36:36	flynn	University funding
2017-12-07 12:41:50	8bit	Is there an email list?
2017-12-07 12:42:12	flynn	not yet - need to get the club or clubs through SAO

2017-12-07 13:44:03	jeffrey	And the linear alg has a much higher constant factor
2017-12-07 13:49:35	flynn	And maybe the cubic-time label means the water is ice cubes

2017-12-07 16:15:04	cshinave	Did u break it with Bitcoin.
2017-12-07 16:15:33	ssjohns	But actually I really hope the price of bitcoin drops now.
2017-12-07 16:15:41	cshinave	Why
2017-12-07 16:15:57	cshinave	It hit 19k and went back to 16 in like 3 minutes today
2017-12-07 16:16:12	ssjohns	So I can buy it!
2017-12-07 16:16:16	cshinave	I assume someone just dumped a crap ton and is trying to introduce some fear
2017-12-07 16:16:38	ssjohns	Probably, but also millions in bitcoin was just stolen in some hack.
2017-12-07 16:16:39	cshinave	My friends have been freaking out

2017-12-07 16:19:53	ssjohns	But this is the new get rich quick scheme. Don't you want to make the same mistake people have been making for literally all of history?
2017-12-07 16:20:01	ssjohns	But yeah I am trying to invest.
2017-12-07 16:20:11	ssjohns	I'm thinking of going with betterment actually.
2017-12-07 16:20:23	cshinave	Betterment and vanguard are both very good
2017-12-07 16:20:36	ssjohns	My coworkers have great returns and it;s a lot easier than anything else.
2017-12-07 16:20:47	cshinave	And much safer
2017-12-07 16:20:48	ssjohns	And yeah I got set up with vangaurd when I started working here.
2017-12-07 16:20:55	ssjohns	Maxing out my contributions.
2017-12-07 16:21:11	cshinave	Max out for match or fed limit
2017-12-07 16:21:14	cshinave	?
2017-12-07 16:24:32	ssjohns	Yeah and my company has 100% match to a certain limit
2017-12-07 16:24:44	ssjohns	So I'm doing that for all the free money.
2017-12-07 16:24:57	ssjohns	I just need to sit on it and I'll be golden in 20 years.
2017-12-07 16:25:13	cshinave	Oh what.
2017-12-07 16:25:16	cshinave	That's super nice.
2017-12-07 16:26:33	ssjohns	Doesn't AR match?
2017-12-07 16:26:47	ssjohns	They have way more money than we do.

2017-12-07 20:22:35	jeffrey	Ugh I asked Prof. Chen if an algs question is meant to be a decision problem or not because one question is a book question that says prove this is NP-complete, and then describes it as "the question of whether you can partition a set such that...", but then the question on the homework sheet says to solve it using that the knapsack problem we did in class where you find the subset is NP-complete. He responded that not every problem is a decision problem and that I should do what it asks.
2017-12-07 20:32:23	mflanag6	algs homework is bad and dumb
2017-12-07 20:33:50	jeffrey	I'm also confused because I'm reasonably sure that only decision problems can be NP
2017-12-07 20:38:14	wtheisen	I cannot wait to be done with Algs
2017-12-07 20:38:26	wtheisen	Good thing I don't have to take anything like that again

2017-12-07 20:40:08	dchiang	only decision problems can be in NP, but it's _very_ common to stretch the definition to include any kind of problem

2017-12-07 20:58:44	jeffrey	the last 3 algs questions are all the same
2017-12-07 20:59:01	pbui	?
2017-12-07 20:59:12	wtheisen	wait do tell @jeffrey
2017-12-07 20:59:39	jeffrey	@wtheisen for each of the last 3 algs problems you can find a transformation between them. solve one, you solve them all
2017-12-07 20:59:59	jeffrey	(sorry for the poor attempt at making a joke about np-completeness fam)
2017-12-07 21:03:11	tweninger	^^fyi this is pretty much all of the work on complexity theory... Finding reductions
2017-12-07 21:21:00	flynn	Hint: reduce to sorting if you can. :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-12-07 21:22:40	dchiang	hint: try to reduce them all from super mario brothers
2017-12-07 21:22:40	flynn	Much more fun than reducing to SAT
2017-12-07 21:25:08	jeffrey	Deciding if you can beat a level of Super Mario Bros is NP-hard.
2017-12-07 21:28:00	jeffrey	Also, super mario maker is turing complete
2017-12-07 21:29:11	dchiang	i'm serious, that would drive your TAs nuts, trying to check whether your reductions from SMB are correct
2017-12-07 21:30:17	mflanag6	the algs TAs are unhelpful anyway
2017-12-07 21:30:24	mflanag6	pissing them off would just make it worse
2017-12-07 21:30:45	jeffrey	but it would also drive me nuts trying to reduce SMB to 2-partition.
2017-12-07 21:32:14	dchiang	well you could lift the reduction of smb to 3sat (or whatever it is, i didn't watch the video) and then 3sat to 2-partition, and try to obfuscate the boundary between the two, haha
2017-12-07 21:32:43	dchiang	ok, i'm not serious, and i don't want to be held responsible
2017-12-07 21:34:38	jeffrey	the video I sent earlier wasn't serious, though it was sited in a series paper that used 3sat, so I might try that, and also print the paper with the proof and attach it to my homework.
2017-12-07 21:37:55	jeffrey	(the video's proof was graph coloring, but it has mario solve graph coloring by going to the store to buy paint, but the NES only had 10 colors so he needed to go on a quest, and because he doesn't have any plumbing jobs he is very hungry so he must go on a Quest for Eat and Dollar, "which spells Q.E.D. so we are done.")
2017-12-07 21:43:15	mflanag6	can I just write "this is trivial" for all my answers and turn it in?  and then argue that they must be missing something
2017-12-07 21:44:07	catvajiac	power move, i like it
2017-12-07 21:44:22	jeffrey	The real paper constructs a mario level that contains constructions equivalent to variables and clauses, which is pretty cool. So that way, if you knew if you could beat a generalized mario level, then you know if you can 3sat
2017-12-07 21:44:47	jeffrey	So now I gotta do 3-sat to 2-partition.
2017-12-07 21:45:13	mflanag6	wouldn't subset sum or knapsack be easier?
2017-12-07 21:45:37	jeffrey	yes but I gotta do it using super mario
2017-12-07 21:45:41	jeffrey	I think I might do
2017-12-07 21:45:56	jeffrey	SMB->3SAT->Subset Sum->2-part
2017-12-07 21:46:17	mflanag6	i digg ity
2017-12-07 21:55:03	dchiang	@mflanag6 I had a math teacher in college who was well-known for saying "There's really nothing to show." I actually tried writing that on an exam (I can't remember anymore whether I really meant it) and got full credit
2017-12-07 21:55:29	mflanag6	man, I should've tried that on my theory exams
2017-12-07 21:59:34	androidkitkat	should i try that on my finals
2017-12-07 22:03:02	mflanag6	Question 1:  Fix the memory leak in the following code
2017-12-07 22:03:02	mflanag6	"There's really nothing to show here"
2017-12-07 22:03:20	wtheisen	@dchiang We definitely had a meme about you saying something like that if I remember correctly
2017-12-07 22:04:13	mflanag6	ramzi used to say something along the lines of "oh that's so trivial" too iirc
2017-12-07 22:13:54	dchiang	i never say that!
2017-12-07 22:16:00	jeffrey	What do you never say?
2017-12-07 22:17:51	jeffrey	Better question, do I email Prof. Chen asking "All of my homework solutions prove problems NP-hard by reduction from the problem of 'Can you beat a given level of the Legend of Zelda', is this acceptable?"
2017-12-07 22:19:01	wtheisen	@wtheisen uploaded a file: lol.jpg https://nd-cse.slack.com/files/U0KQYK7DK/F8CEE0TDL/lol.jpg  and commented: I found it!
2017-12-07 22:19:03	dchiang	"there's really nothing to show"
2017-12-07 22:19:45	tweninger	I once saw an assignment solution with "Proof is left as an exercise for the TA"
2017-12-07 22:20:11	dchiang	oh yes, i probably say "clearly" and "obviously" a lot. though, if that's from a solution set, it may be the ta writing and not me
2017-12-07 22:20:35	wtheisen	I don't remember what it was from, it was a while ago
2017-12-07 22:21:09	tweninger	Iirc, David and I basically said that to our most recent review in the pami revision
2017-12-07 22:21:34	jbaker10	The I see “obviously” the less I trust the person actually understands
2017-12-07 22:21:59	tweninger	If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it
2017-12-07 22:22:10	jbaker10	That’s not necessarily true...
2017-12-07 22:22:22	jeffrey	Explain
2017-12-07 22:22:44	tweninger	Hmm... Proof is left as an exercise to the lugger
2017-12-07 22:23:40	pbui	hey, we re-advertised our SPF position: https://cra.org/job/university-of-notre-dame-special-professional-faculty/ 
2017-12-07 22:23:44	pbui	exciting
2017-12-07 22:24:51	jbaker10	So when are we having undergrad seminar?
2017-12-07 22:25:41	pbui	as soon as u graduate
2017-12-07 22:43:11	pbui	https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/whats-college-good-for/546590/ 
2017-12-08 00:29:48	jbaker10	Jokes on you. Never graduating
2017-12-08 02:23:10	jeffrey	Guy a spider chased me out of my room
2017-12-08 02:23:19	jeffrey	I'll never be happy again
2017-12-08 03:05:38	jeffrey	I have a formal verification that the spider is not in my bed
2017-12-08 03:11:54	jeffrey	The problem of "can I find a spider in Jeffrey's bed" is NP-hard. Proof: reduce 3sat to sjb: given a Boolean expression in 3cnf, cut out pieces of paper, one per clause, such that compatible variables overlap. Cover Jeffrey's bed in spiders. Place paper over spiders. If I can see a spider, then I have found a solution to the Boolean satisfyability problem, otherwise no solution exists.
2017-12-08 03:13:38	jeffrey	@jbaker10  is right i do come here to talk to myself at night
2017-12-08 07:05:07	pbui	It is probably theraputic
2017-12-08 08:23:29	pbui	@alitteke: jbaker10 https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/12/the-contradictions-of-good-teaching/546968/ 
2017-12-08 10:31:41	wtheisen	@pbui when are the kids going to want to start demo'ing?
2017-12-08 10:32:05	pbui	today or monday
2017-12-08 10:32:08	pbui	probably not today
2017-12-08 10:32:13	pbui	some groups sound close
2017-12-08 10:33:38	wtheisen	So should I do an hour today and one sunday? OR two sunday and none today?
2017-12-08 10:33:41	wtheisen	Or waht?
2017-12-08 10:39:56	pbui	id do two sunday and none today
2017-12-08 10:40:04	wtheisen	okay can do
2017-12-08 10:40:06	pbui	but maybe put a message in slack
2017-12-08 10:40:09	pbui	or email the class
2017-12-08 10:40:10	wtheisen	I'll hit the slack about it
2017-12-08 10:40:14	pbui	letting them know
2017-12-08 10:52:32	wtheisen	Okay I slack'ed it
2017-12-08 10:58:37	pbui	i asked a friend to apply for the ND SPF job... this was one of his thoughts: "Brian Kelly is still the coach. seriously!?!"
2017-12-08 10:58:40	pbui	lol
2017-12-08 10:58:54	wtheisen	Give me 6 years and I'll apply
2017-12-08 10:59:02	wtheisen	I'm sure it can wait that long right?\
2017-12-08 10:59:37	pbui	is watching nbrooks3 stream some halo
2017-12-08 11:00:59	flynn	If he applies I can try to get Kelly on his interview schedule
2017-12-08 11:01:12	pbui	lol
2017-12-08 11:01:19	pbui	he'd probably like that to be honest
2017-12-08 11:01:29	flynn	sed 's/try/try and fail/'
2017-12-08 11:04:32	wtheisen	@pbui how exactly are the projects going to work next semester? Do we have complete freedom or what? I'm getting pretty excited
2017-12-08 11:04:55	pbui	there will be a few constraints and requirements
2017-12-08 11:05:07	pbui	but generally u do w/e u want
2017-12-08 11:05:20	wtheisen	The first one has to be for an older system right?
2017-12-08 11:05:23	pbui	yes
2017-12-08 11:05:33	wtheisen	What does that entail? All assembly and hex-code?
2017-12-08 11:05:58	wtheisen	Also are these like half-semester projects or like two week projects?
2017-12-08 11:06:03	pbui	no, u can target DOS
2017-12-08 11:06:06	pbui	w/ c/c++
2017-12-08 11:06:11	pbui	even quickbasic
2017-12-08 11:06:25	pbui	shoot, i ll even take hypercard
2017-12-08 11:06:40	pbui	half-semester projects
2017-12-08 11:06:50	pbui	there will probably be a quarter semester checkpoint
2017-12-08 11:07:09	pbui	u can also do something like arduino or embedded
2017-12-08 11:07:18	pbui	so that would be a c/c++
2017-12-08 11:07:34	pbui	so i would say less "old", more constrained environment
2017-12-08 11:07:51	pbui	so old would fit under constrained, but so would arduinos and other embedded systems
2017-12-08 11:28:37	flynn	Hypercard? http://osxdaily.com/2017/05/27/run-hypercard-macos-web-browser-emu/ 
2017-12-08 11:29:01	pbui	awesome
2017-12-08 11:29:12	flynn	Hypercard was a thing in the 10+ years that I was not paying attention to Macs, but it was big at the time
2017-12-08 11:44:34	androidkitkat	whoa @ssjohns idk if i approve of the new favicon
2017-12-08 11:45:46	androidkitkat	really changes my favorites bar

2017-12-08 12:00:33	walter.scheirer	i wonder how many folks fell for the Fr. Jenkins phishing attack
2017-12-08 12:01:25	flynn	CSE alum Kyle Kozer works there, he should fix it.
2017-12-08 12:03:04	8bit	Wait, so just clarifying, I shouldn't have given Fr. Jenkins my ssn, even if he connected with me on LinkedIn??
2017-12-08 12:11:18	walter.scheirer	ugh... google has forced me to use their new calendar interface
2017-12-08 12:38:07	flynn	Yep I got forced in also - actually it's a big improvement (looks more like OS X calendar app)
2017-12-08 12:38:35	flynn	I'd like to stop using OS X calendar application because it is really flaky about invitations and updates from multiple accounts
2017-12-08 14:44:59	pbui	@wtheisen: are you around?

2017-12-08 16:07:11	walter.scheirer	i'm old and cranky
2017-12-08 16:07:15	walter.scheirer	i should grow a unix beard

2017-12-08 16:37:46	androidkitkat	the inbox bundles dont work well with school stuff imo
2017-12-08 16:38:34	dougsmith	Really? I felt like features were missing, but that's severe.
2017-12-08 16:39:07	androidkitkat	The default bundles are like Social, purchases, finance, promos, updates etc
2017-12-08 16:39:18	androidkitkat	none of that really goes to my school email
2017-12-08 16:39:29	androidkitkat	My personal one it works great

2017-12-08 16:50:00	pbui	so
2017-12-08 16:50:11	androidkitkat	like when i was flying it read my emails and pulled my boarding passes up
2017-12-08 16:50:27	androidkitkat	and gave me reminders about the flight w/o even setting themup
2017-12-08 16:50:52	jbaker10	bui is what we call paranoid

2017-12-08 16:51:57	androidkitkat	they just read everything you do
2017-12-08 16:52:10	androidkitkat	see everywhere you go
