2017-10-31 21:54:27	eightbits	I went and checked the backlog and I see now
2017-10-31 21:55:08	camelot	im confused
2017-10-31 21:55:20	eightbits	the reference, the joke you caled to attn
2017-10-31 21:55:24	camelot	ok
2017-10-31 21:55:26	eightbits	hey sidenote
2017-10-31 21:55:32	eightbits	or i guess not sidenote
2017-10-31 21:55:42	eightbits	just new topic but one you can end if you don't wanna talk abt it
2017-10-31 21:56:54	eightbits	I really don't think the things you think abt doug's thoughts about cat are true.  I promise you are looking into it a lot
2017-10-31 21:57:10	camelot	i dont think i am
2017-10-31 21:57:32	eightbits	And _even in_ a theoretical world in which he did feel something for cat, you wouldn't see it.  He doesn't wear anything on his sleeve
2017-10-31 21:57:45	eightbits	You are reading into it I promise
2017-10-31 21:58:05	camelot	i dont think so
2017-10-31 21:58:08	camelot	have you seen her?
2017-10-31 21:58:17	camelot	who wouldnt want her
2017-10-31 21:59:13	eightbits	I know it's hard to trust me bc it might seem clear but at least try to see that it might be the fact that you're worried, and he's confusing
2017-10-31 21:59:34	eightbits	Like I don't claim to be a perfect interpreter of human behaviour but I really don't see _anything_
2017-10-31 21:59:36	eightbits	to suggest that
2017-10-31 22:04:06	eightbits	and either way you can wonder about what is and isn't in his head but you won't really ever know perfectly.  But you can know clearly he likes spending time with you, and cares about you.  I think that should mean something.
2017-10-31 22:07:00	eightbits	<3 I'm sorry how confusing this is.
2017-10-31 22:10:39	camelot	there
2017-10-31 22:10:47	camelot	there's nothing clear about anything he does
2017-10-31 22:10:54	camelot	i know he cares about you
2017-10-31 22:11:00	camelot	but thats all i know about him
2017-10-31 22:13:19	eightbits	wait me?
2017-10-31 22:13:29	eightbits	the only thing you know about doug is that he cares about 8bit?
2017-10-31 22:13:39	eightbits	just wanna make sure i dereferenced my antecedents correctly
2017-10-31 22:14:30	camelot	yes
2017-10-31 22:15:47	eightbits	you don't see that he cares about you?  He definitely, definitely does.

2017-11-03 14:29:13	eightbits	and then you were like staring at me in response

2017-11-16 00:33:15	eightbits	8bit is logically equivalent with "eh"
2017-11-16 00:34:03	camelot	FALSE
2017-11-16 00:34:23	eightbits	8bit is the feeling you get when you go to take a drink and then realize there's nothing left
2017-11-16 00:35:22	camelot	false
2017-11-16 00:35:25	camelot	objectively false

2017-11-16 00:53:22	camelot	it wasnt the whole bottle, but a significant amount

2017-11-16 02:37:30	camelot	at all
2017-11-16 02:37:42	camelot	i feel stupid for even trying to make that an ecuse
2017-11-16 02:38:16	camelot	like everyone deals with that bullshit and it doesnt set them 3 weeks behind on life
2017-11-16 02:38:44	camelot	NORMAL people dont sleep for 15 hours because "they got their heart broken" thats some weak ass fucking bullshit
2017-11-16 02:39:07	eightbits	bruh
2017-11-16 02:39:09	eightbits	things are relative
2017-11-16 02:39:13	eightbits	you got rekt
2017-11-16 02:39:17	eightbits	you didn't choose to get rekt
2017-11-16 02:39:34	eightbits	you in fact did a lot of things to do you best to function despite being rekt
2017-11-16 02:39:40	eightbits	in that sense you did fucking fantastic
2017-11-16 02:39:51	eightbits	it's totally a valid excuse
2017-11-16 02:40:10	eightbits	You wouldn't say to someone hurting that they're hurting for a stupid reason
2017-11-16 02:40:14	camelot	NO IT TOTALLY FUCKING ISNT
2017-11-16 02:40:15	eightbits	Why are you saying that to yourself?
2017-11-16 02:40:18	camelot	ITS FUCKING BULLSHIT
2017-11-16 02:40:46	eightbits	So imagine
2017-11-16 02:40:55	eightbits	If i had a shitty few weeks -- for no reason
2017-11-16 02:41:09	eightbits	for no reason, I could barely get out of bed, I didn't even want to open my eyes
2017-11-16 02:41:13	eightbits	I felt like shit, every day
2017-11-16 02:41:29	eightbits	Would you tell me "IT'S FUCKING BULLSHIT, EIGHTBIT"
2017-11-16 02:41:49	eightbits	???
2017-11-16 02:42:31	camelot	of course its not fucking bullshit like there obviously would be a reason
2017-11-16 02:42:33	camelot	but like
2017-11-16 02:42:52	camelot	THIS AINT A GOODD ENOUGH REASON ITS STUPID AND DUMB AND I FEEL STUPID AND DUMB AND WEAK AND PATHETIC
2017-11-16 02:44:13	eightbits	You are smart for every decision you made.  You made no stupid decisions.
2017-11-16 02:44:32	camelot	i feel stupid
2017-11-16 02:44:41	eightbits	You are strong for being on the other side of this, out and about.  Do you know how few people could spend every day with someone who broke their heart every day?
2017-11-16 02:45:46	eightbits	You are admirable for how you've handled it.  Camila, you took this hard.  Like a heap of fucking bricks.  You never chose to take it hard.  But you still pulled through and are attending to responsibilities and catching up where you where overwhelmed.
2017-11-16 02:46:27	eightbits	I'm sorry I made you feel bad by bringing it up.
2017-11-16 02:48:19	eightbits	I really hope you come to see that you are neither weak nor stupid for how this went down.  I'm floored you can even think that you did anything stupid.
2017-11-16 02:50:35	camelot	I feel stupid for letting this stupid little thing get to me. I should be stronger than this.
2017-11-16 02:51:42	eightbits	How much you get hurt is not a function of how strong you are.
2017-11-16 02:52:05	camelot	 YES IT IS
2017-11-16 02:52:12	eightbits	No it's not.
2017-11-16 02:52:16	eightbits	It's totally not
2017-11-16 02:52:26	eightbits	Like, being strong is more or less a choice
2017-11-16 02:52:34	eightbits	being hurt isn't.
2017-11-16 02:52:54	eightbits	Being strong isn't not getting hurt... that's just something people react differently
2017-11-16 02:53:18	camelot	how much you get hurt is directly related to how strong you are
2017-11-16 02:54:17	eightbits	So you think someone stronger will always be less hurt?
2017-11-16 02:55:31	camelot	yes
2017-11-16 02:55:48	camelot	because small stupid things wont affect them as much
2017-11-16 02:55:53	eightbits	Is strength a choice?
2017-11-16 02:58:10	camelot	no
2017-11-16 02:59:00	eightbits	Then why are you berating yourself for not having it?  I guess there are two views of strength, that you can choose to be strong, and that you can't.
2017-11-16 02:59:19	eightbits	If you don't think strength is a choice, you can't blame yourself for how strong you are.
2017-11-16 02:59:29	camelot	yes you can 
2017-11-16 02:59:31	camelot	of course you
2017-11-16 02:59:32	camelot	can
2017-11-16 02:59:38	camelot	like it is a choice but its not
2017-11-16 02:59:50	camelot	like you can only be as strong as you are capable 
2017-11-16 02:59:55	camelot	and if you're weak u suck
2017-11-16 03:01:53	eightbits	Can you choose to be strong or not?
2017-11-16 03:02:24	eightbits	And you're not weak, and you don't suck.
2017-11-16 03:04:05	eightbits	Do you really believe the 1960's pull-by-bootstraps BS?  You can't choose to not hurt.  You can't fault yourself for hurting.  You would never say it to any of your friends...you're just berating yourself.
2017-11-16 03:05:18	camelot	i would never say it to any of my friends because it doesn't apply to any of my friends because you all are so strong and wonderful and im weak and pathetic
2017-11-16 03:07:17	eightbits	So if I just had a shitty day, and felt like shit, so couldn't get work done, I was weak?  On a day I didn't particularly have a "good" rason
2017-11-16 03:07:24	eightbits	s/rason/reason/
2017-11-16 03:12:13	eightbits	dude I don't think you're weak or pathetic, am I just stupid?  Or is it possible you are harsh as fuck on yourself
2017-11-16 03:12:20	eightbits	you're aweosme
2017-11-16 03:13:02	eightbits	You're like one of my first friends in college i feel legitimately close with
2017-11-16 03:14:03	camelot	am i irrational?
2017-11-16 03:14:10	camelot	im like legit pissed

2017-11-16 03:17:51	eightbits	<3
2017-11-16 03:53:12	camelot	i hate when he pulls shit like that
2017-11-16 03:53:18	eightbits	wait what

2017-11-17 00:35:43	eightbits	You can probably still dm him.  Your dm's should still have him in there, it should just say "execuittve nerd is now known as aldkfjalksjdf" or whatevs.
2017-11-17 00:35:57	eightbits	You are mad bc he hurt you and is rubbing salt in the wound
2017-11-17 00:36:05	camelot	nope it says "no one by this nick"

2017-11-17 00:36:56	camelot	he has to know what hes doing
2017-11-17 00:37:00	camelot	come on
2017-11-17 00:37:05	camelot	cause hes feeling the same thing
2017-11-17 00:37:16	eightbits	"feeling the same thing"?
2017-11-17 00:37:39	camelot	cat does the same thing
2017-11-17 00:38:02	camelot	self.deprecate() with "no one could ever want me *cry*
2017-11-17 00:38:23	camelot	s/me /me */
2017-11-17 00:38:27	camelot	s/me /me "/
2017-11-17 00:38:38	camelot	s/me /me" /
2017-11-17 00:38:52	eightbits	I am not convinced he likes cat, but i guess it's a stopid convo to have that own't go anywhere really.
2017-11-17 00:39:05	camelot	i know he does
2017-11-17 00:40:15	eightbits	i don't wanna argue about it but know I don't tink it's likely but don't think you're stupid for thinking it
2017-11-17 00:41:51	camelot	why dont u think its likely? it makes perfect sense. Cat is Cat. Smart, beautiful, awesome, great Cat. Literally how could anyone NOT fall for her?
2017-11-17 00:43:51	eightbits	 you are all of those things friend.  and also people don't just fall for anyone who meets general criteria magically
2017-11-17 00:44:22	camelot	false. kinda yeah.
2017-11-17 00:45:53	eightbits	s/false/definitely true/    also attraction is so much more complicated than trait1 + trait2 + trait3 + trait4
2017-11-17 00:46:35	camelot	yeah but its cat
2017-11-17 00:49:18	eightbits	and cat is wonderful and so are you
2017-11-17 00:49:52	camelot	one of those is true
2017-11-17 00:51:08	eightbits	no, cat is wonderful too (:
2017-11-17 00:51:20	eightbits	<3
2017-11-17 00:52:51	camelot	that was the one truth
2017-11-17 00:53:54	eightbits	that was the two truth :D
2017-11-17 00:54:07	camelot	no
2017-11-17 00:54:32	eightbits	Sorry you don't see it.

2017-11-17 00:59:07	camelot	OF COURSE IT HAS TO DO WITH ME LACKING SOMETHING
2017-11-17 00:59:13	camelot	im just not good enough
2017-11-17 01:01:59	eightbits	I don't know that I can say anything to convince you otherwise, but at least consider: why would I say that you are amazing?  like, am I just stoopid?
2017-11-17 01:03:45	eightbits	there's a duck!
2017-11-17 01:03:53	eightbits	oh you got it
2017-11-17 01:05:24	camelot	you're not stoopid
2017-11-17 01:05:46	eightbits	then maybe I have a point?
2017-11-17 01:06:30	camelot	stop using reverse psychology on me
2017-11-17 01:07:58	eightbits	I enjoy spending time with you.  You are so fun to talk to, and I feel like I actually have someone who cares about me, which (i don't want to sound mopey) doesn't happen too often, and has meant a lot to me.  I'm gonna miss you a ton.  like, a fuckton.  You're such a good friend to me.
2017-11-17 01:08:29	eightbits	it's not reverse psychology lol, you're just a really awesome person who doesn't see that they're a really awesome person and I wish you did
2017-11-17 01:08:34	eightbits	Or at least a little bit

2017-11-19 22:09:24	eightbits	you are a wonderful* person
2017-11-19 22:09:47	camelot	cause i always make plans with ili and then decide theres something id rather do much more without her and bail
2017-11-19 22:09:56	camelot	im a bad friend
2017-11-19 22:13:57	eightbits	You also shouldn't feel obligated to not change plans you made over a yearish in advance
2017-11-19 22:14:06	eightbits	but i don't want to seem biased bc you kno
2017-11-19 22:14:13	eightbits	i'm not a disinterested party

2017-11-19 22:14:57	camelot	how the hell am i gonna get my mom to agree?
2017-11-19 22:15:45	eightbits	Seriously, tell her me and doug are gay.  additionally, you don't _really_ need your mom to agree.  It would be nice to have her approval on it but you also should have some level of independent decision making
2017-11-19 22:15:53	eightbits	it's literally your senior year
2017-11-19 22:16:13	eightbits	I would more view it as "how do i make my mom not worried" rather than "how make her agree"
2017-11-19 22:25:37	camelot	no but really like
2017-11-19 22:25:48	camelot	my parents are paying for this

2017-11-19 22:26:05	eightbits	oh i see
2017-11-19 22:26:12	eightbits	depends on how you want to look at it
2017-11-19 22:26:24	eightbits	you can either explain why for various reasons it's not a concern
2017-11-19 22:26:44	eightbits	or lie and say you're rooming with girls or gay dudes or something
2017-11-19 22:40:34	camelot	fuck it

2017-11-19 22:49:10	eightbits	alternatively you could say we are super religious lol
2017-11-19 22:49:21	eightbits	maybe both
2017-11-19 22:49:29	eightbits	say we are super catholic, and also, super gay

2017-11-19 22:53:41	eightbits	but do you think you're the person with whom she's closest?
2017-11-19 22:53:46	eightbits	like, is it assymetrical?
2017-11-19 22:54:10	camelot	that month that we werent talking she said she literally didnt talk to people because she had no frieds

2017-11-30 20:53:08	eightbits	it's all gud
2017-11-30 20:56:30	camelot	no because you always say that he didnt't mean anything by it, but the more he does things like this, the more it makes me think he's doing it on purposr
2017-11-30 20:56:54	eightbits	I mean that doesn't mean you shouldn't talk to me about it
2017-11-30 20:57:07	eightbits	But I like realize he isn't the queen of social graces or anything
2017-11-30 20:57:38	eightbits	so I feel like it's much more likely he's doing something stoopit than malicious

2017-11-30 22:23:17	eightbits	people deal with it differently
2017-11-30 22:24:05	eightbits	but overall it's not like people are normally like "OH shucks i got rejected i'm glad i'm fine"
2017-11-30 22:27:04	camelot	well yes but most people don't lose all brain functionality
2017-11-30 22:29:15	eightbits	yeah neither do you, and a lot of people take it hard
2017-11-30 22:32:01	camelot	oh no i do
2017-11-30 22:32:09	camelot	when im sad i cant focus on anything
2017-11-30 22:32:30	eightbits	I mean by anything you mean complicated school tasks
2017-11-30 22:32:59	eightbits	akk just said "i wonder what happened to camelot"
2017-11-30 22:33:03	eightbits	btw
2017-11-30 22:33:15	camelot	he's like the only one who actually cares that i'm gone
2017-11-30 22:33:22	camelot	he's invited me twice
2017-11-30 22:33:31	camelot	but no one else has even mentioned it
2017-11-30 22:33:37	eightbits	uh
2017-11-30 22:33:41	 *	eightbits raises hand, like a lot
2017-11-30 22:33:46	camelot	i just feel forgotten but like its cool
2017-11-30 22:33:52	camelot	you too i guess
2017-11-30 22:33:55	camelot	meh
2017-11-30 22:34:20	camelot	he just invited me again
2017-11-30 22:34:21	camelot	cute
2017-11-30 22:34:47	eightbits	I'm also guessing a few people ( pnutz, trogdor ) recognize it's probably because things are tense, even if they don't understand why, so they don't wanna press the issue
2017-11-30 22:35:24	camelot	nope nope they dont care
2017-11-30 22:35:33	camelot	if they cared they would ask
2017-11-30 22:36:43	eightbits	There are lots of times I personally have been worried about someone, wished I knew how they were doing, and still didn't bring it up, because I was worried brinigng it up would make it worse.
2017-11-30 22:36:48	camelot	hey i suck, but do you have any monies? I don't have my wallet on me and i'm kind of hungry
2017-11-30 22:37:21	eightbits	absolutely
2017-11-30 22:37:23	eightbits	come over here :D
2017-11-30 22:37:42	camelot	i think thats dumb, usually being on the wrong side of that, not being aasked just proves my belief that no one gives a shit about me
2017-11-30 22:37:44	eightbits	also stop the self deprecate
2017-11-30 22:49:36	camelot	cant

2017-11-30 23:12:52	eightbits	They said they were mad at you?
2017-11-30 23:13:50	camelot	cat's pissed that i made her sit in startup for 4.5 hours and didn't have the maturity to respond to her about the diggums project
2017-11-30 23:14:31	camelot	doug "is trying to do something serious" and reminded me that he's told me three times to send h4x-mas information in an email to him
2017-11-30 23:16:01	eightbits	Sorry things are tense.  I'm here for you.
2017-11-30 23:16:25	eightbits	It will improve.  things have worse times and better times as of recent and this falls squarely into a worse time
2017-11-30 23:16:40	camelot	i hate everything

2017-12-01 16:51:24	camelot	1/7
2017-12-01 16:56:09	eightbits	2/7 is like, a lot considering you only have close relationships with a subset
2017-12-01 16:56:57	camelot	farse

2017-12-01 16:58:38	eightbits	at least i dont think
2017-12-01 16:59:49	camelot	and yet akk cares more about me missing than 2 of my best friends

2017-12-10 19:54:34	camelot	is me
2017-12-10 19:54:56	eightbits	When he's not ok with saying something it's about LGBT, because he doesn't want to joke about that, even a little.  There's very little else he never talks about but mentions in such a way.
2017-12-10 19:59:34	camelot	hm?
2017-12-10 19:59:39	camelot	he jokes about that a lot though

2017-12-10 20:08:07	camelot	which makes me think he was making another "girls dont like me" joke
2017-12-10 20:08:29	eightbits	maybe
2017-12-10 20:09:04	eightbits	but i think unlikely
2017-12-10 20:09:41	camelot	i dont think so

2017-12-25 00:19:13	camelot	si
2017-12-25 00:19:59	eightbits	hrmmm
2017-12-25 00:20:08	eightbits	I'm having trouble understanding your soln gimme a sec
2017-12-25 00:22:02	eightbits	also, this bit doesn't make sense to me
2017-12-25 00:22:06	eightbits	   for pipe in pipes:
2017-12-25 00:22:08	eightbits	      b = []
2017-12-25 00:22:10	eightbits	      if pipe[0] == 0:
2017-12-25 00:22:21	eightbits	because isn't pipe[0] a list of two things?
2017-12-25 00:31:15	camelot	no, pipe is 0/1
2017-12-25 00:31:24	camelot	sorry, (0, 1)
2017-12-25 00:33:46	eightbits	wait is that equivalent to 
2017-12-25 00:33:50	eightbits	for pipe in pipes.keys()
2017-12-25 00:33:52	eightbits	?
2017-12-25 00:46:16	camelot	yes
2017-12-25 00:46:26	camelot	i got d19 :)
2017-12-25 08:05:07	eightbits	:D :D nice
2017-12-25 12:51:04	camelot	<3
2017-12-25 12:51:17	camelot	im only missing 4 total challenges now :D
2017-12-25 12:51:21	camelot	bork

2017-12-25 19:55:52	eightbits	cute + fun
2017-12-25 20:01:53	camelot	its super cute and i love it
2017-12-25 20:02:28	eightbits	:D :D :D i got the coders at work book pbui recommended too
2017-12-25 20:05:31	camelot	cutee
2017-12-25 20:53:32	camelot	I ONLY HAVE TO FINISH 13 AND 17
2017-12-25 20:54:53	eightbits	YAYYYYY YOU ARE AWESOME :D
2017-12-25 20:57:46	camelot	but i REALLY dont get those :/
2017-12-25 20:57:52	 *	camelot is stuck
2017-12-25 20:59:26	eightbits	on which more
2017-12-25 20:59:30	eightbits	like which r u workin on
2017-12-25 20:59:44	camelot	17
2017-12-25 21:00:50	eightbits	p2?
2017-12-25 21:01:37	camelot	yepp
2017-12-25 21:01:48	camelot	like i could just run in 5 billion times but lol no
2017-12-25 21:01:54	camelot	i cant figure out the trick for it
2017-12-25 21:02:00	camelot	and I've been trying since it came out
2017-12-25 21:02:05	camelot	i got part1 that day
2017-12-25 21:03:05	eightbits	hmmm gimme a sec and I'll see if I can hint
2017-12-25 21:04:39	eightbits	do you have to track the entire state?
2017-12-25 21:06:48	camelot	huh?
2017-12-25 21:11:42	eightbits	Are you sure you have to keep track of the entire array?
2017-12-25 21:11:48	eightbits	(hint you don't)
2017-12-25 21:18:08	eightbits	:D
2017-12-25 21:18:35	eightbits	the length of the array is pretty predictable, right?  It grows by one every round.
2017-12-25 21:18:57	camelot	derp?
2017-12-25 21:19:43	camelot	oh okay yeah that makes sense
2017-12-25 21:19:49	camelot	sorry i forgot the problem
2017-12-25 21:20:08	camelot	(trying to dd my ubuntu pi img onto my sd card)
2017-12-25 21:22:14	eightbits	it okei :D
2017-12-25 21:22:24	eightbits	it runs fast if you don't track a big array
2017-12-25 21:26:30	camelot	but i need to track stuff no?
2017-12-25 21:32:06	eightbits	You only _really_ need to track the value after zero right
2017-12-25 21:33:26	camelot	!!!!!!!!
2017-12-25 21:33:33	camelot	i got it!!
2017-12-25 21:33:35	camelot	thanks!!!
2017-12-25 21:33:38	camelot	:D
2017-12-25 21:33:49	camelot	that makes so much sense
2017-12-25 21:34:02	camelot	like i only really need to track the last number whose index was 1
2017-12-25 21:34:14	camelot	i dont care about the actual array
2017-12-25 21:35:55	eightbits	YAYYYYY :D
2017-12-25 21:35:58	eightbits	i loved that one
2017-12-25 21:36:03	eightbits	it took me a bit for it to click
2017-12-25 21:36:10	eightbits	but It's a pretty cool one
2017-12-25 21:36:36	camelot	NOW THE LAST ONE
2017-12-25 21:36:37	camelot	13
2017-12-25 21:36:39	camelot	bork bork
2017-12-25 21:37:02	eightbits	YAY :D
2017-12-25 21:37:10	eightbits	p2?
2017-12-25 21:37:22	eightbits	or p
2017-12-25 21:37:24	eightbits	1
2017-12-25 21:37:52	camelot	p2
2017-12-25 21:37:59	camelot	p1 was easy and fun
2017-12-25 21:45:06	eightbits	p2 is hard and fun :D
2017-12-25 21:45:14	eightbits	have you figured out how to simulate a delay?
2017-12-25 21:47:57	camelot	yeah 
2017-12-25 21:48:18	camelot	i think i have an idea how to do p2
2017-12-25 21:49:26	eightbits	how so?
2017-12-25 21:50:02	eightbits	once you figure out how to delay it shouldn't be tough
2017-12-25 21:50:07	eightbits	you just try delays until it works
2017-12-25 21:50:21	camelot	that's what i was doing, but stuff was borking
2017-12-25 21:51:17	eightbits	hmmmm
2017-12-25 21:51:24	eightbits	are you sure you're simulating a delay right?
2017-12-25 21:53:11	camelot	instead of starting at 0 and going to the max depth, i start at 'delay' and go to 'delay+max depth'
2017-12-25 21:57:33	eightbits	can you yld me your code? it sounds like you implemented it different than me
2017-12-25 21:59:35	camelot	part1: https://yld.me/hKQ
