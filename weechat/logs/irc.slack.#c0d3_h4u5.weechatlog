2017-11-20 15:34:03	ccarball	hello my three super religious girl friends 
2017-11-20 15:34:31	dougsmith	...
2017-11-20 15:34:35	dougsmith	facepalms
2017-11-20 15:34:53	dougsmith	feels pain, but doesn't complain so as to not get called out
2017-11-20 15:34:57	ccarball	no shh deborah
2017-11-20 15:37:14	dougsmith	doesn't like the names. Would rather not do the names when not absolutely necessary.
2017-11-20 15:37:38	dougsmith	isn't saying any of this, just thinking in an irc-visible wavelength
2017-11-20 15:39:34	8bit	deng, where did you learn to think like that
2017-11-20 15:40:00	8bit	also, when did you start thinking in some sort of 3rd personness
2017-11-20 15:40:14	8bit	also, have we briefed alitteke or is he just super confused right now
2017-11-20 15:40:37	dougsmith	yes
2017-11-20 15:40:42	alitteke	What dis
2017-11-20 15:40:42	dougsmith	to all the questions
2017-11-20 15:44:49	ccarball	okok sorry doogle
2017-11-20 15:51:36	8bit	idk about you but if anyone asks me I'm tammy who grew up catholic
2017-11-20 16:01:31	dougsmith	Oh yeah, die with the lie, that's how it works.
2017-11-20 16:01:53	dougsmith	But I need to seperate my con life from my personal life.
2017-11-24 22:41:28	dougsmith	Okay, a few orders of housing business:
2017-11-24 22:41:28	dougsmith	1. 8bit: who are you again?
2017-11-24 22:41:28	dougsmith	2. Why are we doing this in the department academic chat?
2017-11-24 22:41:28	dougsmith	3. I know you all skipped to the last item of the list, that's fine, this is the only one that matters: we need to start applying for houses for next year and I'd rather apply to the houses we want one at a time (there's a lot of application fees I don't want to pay). Which means we should all start searching/agreeing on houses: I attached a spreadsheet with one house on it so we can agree on the math and then start posting good houses

2017-11-24 22:52:48	ccarball	dougsmith: can we have edit access?
2017-11-24 23:01:41	dougsmith	As of right now should be anyone with link can edit
2017-11-24 23:02:51	ccarball	si merci
2017-11-24 23:53:35	8bit	why tf is there an application fee
2017-11-24 23:54:06	8bit	dougsmith: uh your ghost of christmas...uh...north?
2017-11-25 00:00:03	dougsmith	Yeah... I guess it keeps losers from applying to every house in SouthBend, Dublin Village assures you that they reserve a unit immediately and let you use it once you prove you can pay for it, so I'm predicting low-risk.
2017-11-25 00:01:31	alitteke	are the houses furnished?
2017-11-25 00:02:11	alitteke	it says they are
2017-11-25 00:02:17	8bit	score
2017-11-25 00:02:17	alitteke	but that is a very vague term i have learned
2017-11-25 00:02:20	8bit	good pt
2017-11-25 00:02:24	8bit	we should call(?)
2017-11-25 00:03:08	alitteke	yes
2017-11-25 00:03:22	alitteke	I think it probably means we get a couch, table+chairs, bed+matress
2017-11-25 00:03:37	dougsmith	Furnished is loosely defined, I would filter good houses further by how much furniture we have to bring.
2017-11-25 00:04:24	alitteke	agreed
2017-11-25 00:05:18	alitteke	also, the fourth bedroom, I do now know where it is
2017-11-25 00:06:04	ccarball	cheaper houses it seems from what i saw are generally unfurnished, which is bad, cause I cant fly to nd with a mattress...
2017-11-25 00:07:21	alitteke	*do not
2017-11-25 00:18:46	dougsmith	Just give me a couch 3 matresses is fine with low rent
2017-11-27 10:37:00	dougsmith	So, I only want to apply to the good options, what's our deadline for finshing the first round of house hunting and deciding on application candidates?
2017-11-27 10:42:49	ccarball	dec 8
2017-11-27 10:47:10	dougsmith	For round 1? And apply over finals week?
2017-11-27 10:48:48	ccarball	ah no idk
2017-11-27 10:48:50	ccarball	ahhh
2017-11-27 10:50:51	dougsmith	We could always evoke condition P...
2017-11-27 10:52:27	ccarball	whats that
2017-11-27 10:56:25	dougsmith	P - PUT everything down. PROCEED to the nearest PUBLIC PLACE, and PANIC in an un-PRODUCTIVE fashion
2017-11-27 10:57:17	dougsmith	I float Dec 3.

2017-12-03 19:24:56	8bit	sorry just making it pop oup
2017-12-03 19:38:37	dougsmith	@channel: Today is deadline day, the day when we wanted to plan out visits and discuss whether renting was possible Here's what I see on the spreadsheet [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-03 19:38:59	dougsmith	Irish row/Dublin village are both REALLY expensive
2017-12-03 19:39:52	dougsmith	LaSalle (which was the cheapest house), is pricier than expected at $550/person/month unfurnished and $600 unfurnished
2017-12-03 19:40:56	dougsmith	Two other houses are being offered by the same realtor: 125N Eddy's St and 1019 Madison St at $450 unfurnished of $550 furnished.
2017-12-03 19:41:07	dougsmith	Those are the cheapest things on the sheet so far.
2017-12-03 19:42:35	alitteke	I don’t think you’re going to kind anything cheaper than about 600 if you get something decent based on what I’ve heard from people on rowing who had houses
2017-12-03 19:45:47	dougsmith	Yeah, the expensive stuff goes wild but $600 is about par
2017-12-03 19:45:54	dougsmith	Is it usually more for utilities?
2017-12-03 19:50:24	alitteke	I think it’s like 70 per person for utilities depending what you’re paying for
2017-12-03 19:57:29	dougsmith	I could only get estimates, but they're around that.
2017-12-03 19:57:49	dougsmith	Advantage to anyone who isn't billing 4 computer nerds for internet/electricity
2017-12-03 19:58:09	dougsmith	leaves dreams of an in-house computing cluster behind
2017-12-03 20:05:09	ccarball	sadness
2017-12-03 20:07:02	dougsmith	Assuming none of these places are active meth labs, we might find a place running under $10000/person all told. Not THAT sad.
2017-12-03 20:07:20	dougsmith	Do we want to visit all of them? Or do we want to eliminate a few?
2017-12-03 20:07:44	ccarball	how many total for visiting them all?
2017-12-03 20:21:26	dougsmith	There are the two cheap ones and LaSalle in third place. So 3.
2017-12-03 20:21:33	dougsmith	Unless I've overlooked a house
2017-12-03 20:34:27	alitteke	the two cheap ones being Eddy street and madison?
2017-12-03 20:42:25	dougsmith	Yes.
2017-12-03 20:43:26	ccarball	i vote we visit the cheap ones
2017-12-03 20:51:05	alitteke	I don’t think your three cheapest ones come with beds
2017-12-03 20:51:26	dougsmith	Hmmmm... even furnished?
2017-12-03 20:51:31	alitteke	no
2017-12-03 20:51:36	alitteke	not the Madison one for sure
2017-12-03 20:51:40	alitteke	based on any pcitures
2017-12-03 20:53:14	alitteke	I don’t really think the lasalle one does either
2017-12-03 20:53:20	dougsmith	The Eddy's street one seems to be the same, so it'd probably be the same deal.
2017-12-03 20:54:26	alitteke	Based on the list on the Kramer furnishing ones it doesn’t seem like most of the ones under 650 come with furnish
2017-12-03 20:55:26	dougsmith	Yeah, not by default ($450). It's weird that they'd offer me furnish then...
2017-12-03 20:57:59	alitteke	It is hard to figure out whihc of these are furnished with beds
2017-12-03 20:58:32	alitteke	Also, if we apply to the Dublin Village ones by 12/15 the price per person is 6225
2017-12-03 20:58:36	alitteke	*625
2017-12-03 21:00:37	dougsmith	Assuming we can't furnish anything else, that's actually one of the cheaper options (I assume no one's overly interested in self-furnishing)
2017-12-03 21:01:33	alitteke	I’m not really
2017-12-03 21:01:58	alitteke	I’m not super sure what they provide, but even still, it is a nice option, and is one of the closer to campus options
2017-12-03 21:02:16	alitteke	I’m not super sure what the other options do in terms of furnishing but it really doesn’t look like much
2017-12-03 21:02:28	dougsmith	So we have time for one round of visits before that window closes, how about one of the cheaper ones to get a clear furnishing answer and Dublin village?
2017-12-03 21:05:17	alitteke	Ok, that should work, but we could also split and try to call some people to figure out the furnishing situation too tomorrow
2017-12-03 21:05:24	alitteke	I can do some of that
2017-12-03 21:13:18	ccarball	alitteke: 625 as opposed to what? (was it 675?)
2017-12-03 21:13:22	alitteke	yes
2017-12-03 21:13:26	ccarball	okay
2017-12-03 21:13:38	ccarball	dougsmith: yes those 2 visits should work
2017-12-03 21:13:39	alitteke	A 4: Each unit is furnished individually by the owners with luxury home-like furniture, meaning no plain bulk furniture! The units have couches, tables, chairs, bar stools, TV, balcony, and many have an easy-start fireplace. Rooms have a bed, night stand, dresser, closet, and many with ceiling fans. Laundry room too!
2017-12-03 21:13:49	alitteke	^What dublin village says it is furnished with
2017-12-03 21:14:03	ccarball	whoa
2017-12-03 21:14:05	ccarball	tv too
2017-12-03 21:14:07	ccarball	hm
2017-12-03 21:20:00	alitteke	Also, the bus comes by, if that means anything to you guys
2017-12-03 21:20:12	alitteke	I guess two of us have cars tho
2017-12-03 21:21:33	dougsmith	Yeah... but not driving every day would be better for the environment.
2017-12-03 21:22:06	alitteke	This is true
2017-12-03 21:22:19	dougsmith	Dublin village has a lot of stuff, and we don't seem to be saving anything by going anywhere else. As long as we all agree that it's within our price range.
2017-12-03 21:23:49	alitteke	625 for that amount is very good, assuming it is what it reads
2017-12-03 21:24:23	dougsmith	Yeah. Talk about spending senior year in style...
2017-12-03 21:36:16	dougsmith	So if there's no objections, I'll call the Eddy
2017-12-03 21:36:31	dougsmith	's street guy tomorow to arrange a visit
2017-12-03 21:36:47	dougsmith	Can someone else contact Dublin Village?
2017-12-03 21:37:01	alitteke	I can do it
2017-12-03 21:37:12	dougsmith	And can we all post our availability to for visit times?
2017-12-03 21:37:28	dougsmith	No one should have to view alone, and 3-4 of us would be the most democratic

2017-12-05 09:33:35	dougsmith	Hey squad! The house guy got back to me about a meeting. He wants to do 4-6 Friday. Unfortunately, this was one of the times I think everyone but me could make it, so I wanted to make sure y'all were still free/cool to meet.
2017-12-05 09:33:48	dougsmith	@channel [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-05 09:37:58	8bit	wait friday?

2017-12-05 09:39:02	8bit	I definitely want to see walters talk this week
2017-12-05 09:44:08	dougsmith	That's 2/4 out... and we all go to LUG. Reschedule. alitteke any luck with Dublin village so we don't get a time collision with that.
2017-12-05 09:46:21	8bit	is it infeasible to make a shorter visit from 4-x where x allows us to get to the talk?
2017-12-05 09:47:56	dougsmith	I can try... anyone else willing/able to go if it moves to 4:00 (or 3:45) to 4:45?
2017-12-05 10:26:08	alitteke	I got an email back this morning, they said that we can schedule it whenever
2017-12-05 10:28:32	dougsmith	Cool, then I'll try to reschedle the Wednesday thing.
2017-12-05 10:30:23	alitteke	They just need to give the tenants 24 hours notice, so Friday morning work for everyone?
2017-12-05 10:30:43	dougsmith	Works for me
2017-12-05 10:31:31	8bit	how early are we thinking?  I have an 8:20.
2017-12-05 10:31:32	8bit	oh wait

2017-12-05 11:17:01	alitteke	They said friday at 9 might be too early, but saturday afternooon also works
2017-12-05 11:27:38	alitteke	but they said it should work on friday for the most part
2017-12-05 11:34:23	ccarball	Friday morning works maybe 10 or 11 better though for tenants (and my sanity)
2017-12-05 11:34:45	ccarball	I don't mind wednesday as long as we dont miss lug
2017-12-05 11:44:50	dougsmith	They haven't gotten back to me on modified schedule. I'm willing to do Friday or later Saturday.
2017-12-05 11:45:20	ccarball	Saturday also works if I wasn't clear before
2017-12-05 11:58:33	dougsmith	Alright, Wednesday can happen before LUG(but not for me). Is everyone still cool to meet this guy at 812 E LaSalle?
2017-12-05 12:01:22	ccarball	what time?
2017-12-05 12:02:19	dougsmith	3:45 or 4:00, depending on who can make when
2017-12-05 21:49:15	dougsmith	@channel moving visit to Saturday. When can we house? I don't want to go much after lunch... [cc: ccarball]

2017-12-06 10:35:56	dougsmith	Okay, not sure if everyone was being sarcastic if I schedule a visit for Saturday at 1. Kinda too tired to care. CAn I get a set of yes/no 's ?

2017-12-07 18:12:59	alitteke	Apparently tenants are not happy about 10 AM visit to Dublin village, what are afternoon availabilities and Saturday afternoon availabilities
2017-12-07 18:15:20	8bit	Wait, looking at backlog I'm a tad confused.  Were we planning on doing something on friday _and_ saturday or just satureday?
2017-12-07 18:16:30	alitteke	And
2017-12-07 18:18:30	dougsmith	Friday I have to be on-campus for a meeting 12:30-2:30. Otherwise I'm free. Saturday is good except for the visit to Eddy's street at 1 (which I'm told should be done by 2).
2017-12-07 18:35:48	alitteke	Can I set up tomorrow for 3 then?
2017-12-07 18:39:22	ccarball	tomorrow at 3 works for me
2017-12-07 18:44:09	ccarball	I totally forgot I work saturday. I'm getting someone to cover my shift from 12:30-2:30 though so we should be fine. If not, you guys go one without me. 3/4 is fine too
2017-12-07 19:35:21	8bit	saturday 2-4 i may be unavailable.  review session.

2017-12-08 14:11:19	alitteke	Do we want to meet at Stanford at 2:40ish walk to cars and shuttle ourselves over? @channel [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-08 14:20:09	8bit	sounds good
2017-12-08 14:34:29	dougsmith	Sounds cool, leaving fitz now and see y'all in the lobby. Do we need two cars or one?
2017-12-08 14:35:48	ccarball	derp
2017-12-08 14:36:03	ccarball	tim and i will leave startup now then
