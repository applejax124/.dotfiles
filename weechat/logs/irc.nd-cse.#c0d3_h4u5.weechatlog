2017-12-09 10:53:43	8bit	I am.
2017-12-09 11:58:08	ccarball	yes okay i'll be there
2017-12-09 11:59:19	8bit	Is 20 mins sufficient?  I don't know how long the drive is but dpeending on who's car we are planning on using it might be a bit of a walk
2017-12-09 12:12:06	dougsmith	Good point... I haven't been able to wake Andrew, but I can pull my car around so it's in Stanford lot and it won't matter.
2017-12-09 12:18:09	ccarball	yeah that'd be good probably
2017-12-09 18:30:01	dougsmith	Okay, it seems we're all in on Dublin village. Has anyone filled out the application and if not could everyone send an email that they will check tonight for stamping the initial application.
2017-12-09 18:54:54	ccarball	my nd email works
2017-12-09 19:39:54	alitteke	alitteke@nd.edu mailto:alitteke@nd.edu  is good for me
2017-12-09 23:54:57	dougsmith	Everyone should have gotten an email with housing forms. If you havent, get back to me ASAP b/c I put in your email wrong.
2017-12-09 23:55:32	dougsmith	I know the form gives 7 days, but we're trying to get the discounted rates which I believe means handing them in on Monday (?)
2017-12-09 23:58:51	ccarball	dec 15 no?
2017-12-09 23:59:01	ccarball	i got the email btw
2017-12-10 10:43:28	8bit	It looks like I need all your home addresses, DOB's...and SSNs(?) to apply?
2017-12-10 10:44:16	8bit	Timothy Burchfield: address is 3043 Shenandoah Dr., Carpentersville, IL, 60110.  DOB: 3/20/98
2017-12-10 11:26:10	8bit	Also, why is there only space for one coapplicant... Am i being stupid?
2017-12-10 12:06:37	alitteke	Iâ€™m not sure, that does seem kinda weird
2017-12-10 12:34:58	dougsmith	Pretty sure the email said each of us fill out the apps for ourselves,  coapplicants are co-signers for each of us (parents or financial dependents)
