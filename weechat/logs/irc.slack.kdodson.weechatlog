2017-12-05 13:27:36	ccarball	got it
2017-12-05 22:00:43	kdodson	hey how's the video going? Let me know when the URL is up I wanna see it :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-12-05 22:01:45	ccarball	yes ma'am
2017-12-05 22:01:55	ccarball	honestly though it won't be finished until pretty late
2017-12-05 22:02:08	ccarball	but it WILL be finished and it will be good
2017-12-05 22:18:58	kdodson	sweet I'm excited. Thanks so much for making it! And btw you can probably get a free trial of Camtasia for editing the video :slightly_smiling_face:
2017-12-05 23:37:21	ccarball	okay perfect
2017-12-05 23:37:22	ccarball	thanks
2017-12-06 14:17:54	kdodson	hey where does logout not work for you? I just tested it
2017-12-06 14:18:21	ccarball	just when i go on the site and try to click logout, nothing happens
2017-12-06 14:20:24	kdodson	really? mine works...
2017-12-06 14:20:33	kdodson	it takes a second..
2017-12-06 14:20:41	kdodson	idk why that would happen
2017-12-06 14:20:59	ccarball	if it works for everyone else it might just be my browser or something
2017-12-06 14:21:37	kdodson	that's pretty weird. maybe I'll ask Ivy if it works for her
2017-12-06 14:22:19	ccarball	okay cool
2017-12-06 14:22:28	ccarball	let me know if theres anything you need me to do
