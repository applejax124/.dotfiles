I have databases and networks homework due Monday and I don't know why, but it's been really hard for me to focus on anything this week. I'm just gonna need a little time to get them done if that's okay?

2017-12-15 17:16:54	camelot	question: python's modulus operator borks up if the first number is huge... is it me or is it python?
2017-12-15 17:17:16	pnutzh4x0r	?
2017-12-15 17:36:22	camelot	i figured it out
2017-12-15 17:36:28	camelot	i was just being stoopid like always
2017-12-18 12:53:49	camelot	how come checking for the existence of a key in a dict in python takes so much longer than calling .get() on the dictionary?
2017-12-18 12:57:46	pnutzh4x0r	how are u checking the key
2017-12-18 12:58:18	pnutzh4x0r	key in d.keys() -> linear search b/c u are generating a list of keys and then searching the list
2017-12-18 12:58:27	pnutzh4x0r	key in d -> constant time look up
2017-12-18 13:41:31	camelot	key in d is how im checking
2017-12-18 13:42:23	pnutzh4x0r	that should be the same as .get
2017-12-18 13:45:50	camelot	that's the one change i made that suddenly made my code run faster
2017-12-18 13:46:36	pnutzh4x0r	i dunno, id have to see the code in context
