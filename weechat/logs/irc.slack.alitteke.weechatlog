2017-10-26 00:09:55	alitteke	I’m not sure I guess, just how much he might actually know

2017-10-26 00:10:54	ccarball	I'm just not sure who knows and I'm scared of mentioning things in front of people and stuff 
2017-10-26 00:11:07	alitteke	Well, I don’t really care that mcuh
2017-10-26 00:11:20	alitteke	unless they’re going to care for the wrong reasons, I don’t really care that much who knos

2017-11-14 20:20:01	ccarball	oh gotcha thanks
2017-11-30 21:57:37	ccarball	hey do you know anything about unlocking iphones? like its locked to sprint right now and i want to be able to use it with at&t
2017-11-30 21:58:01	alitteke	I think you might be able to do it with switching out the SIM card?
2017-11-30 21:58:53	ccarball	Definitely not that easy. I've done it before by like taking it to places that will unlock it, but i wanted to see if i could do it myself for free
2017-11-30 21:59:21	alitteke	Usually i think it’s just a sim card that is locked to a network at least in some sense
