2017-12-18 13:21:34	dsmith47	Project Managers: feel free to post links to your repositories and talk about any issues that you have up currently. Everyone please try to bookmark/star/follow these links, so we don't have to spam-post them all month.
2017-12-18 13:22:51	dsmith47	First project up is our r/place clone: openplace: https://github.com/dsmith47/open-place 
2017-12-18 13:24:41	dsmith47	We've currently bootstrapped the backend, with the frontend coming soon (anybody who's feeling REALLY ambitious and wants to bootstrap the react app can just PM me), so today we're mostly looking for designers and backend developers to implement models for tracking users and canvas state.
2017-12-18 13:24:46	dsmith47	Happy Hacking!

2017-12-25 20:35:36	tburchfi	What should I learn/read to know enough to be dangerous with a database?
2017-12-25 20:36:35	dsmith47	To be dangerous, just rm the binary
2017-12-25 20:38:32	dsmith47	To learn databases, I'd suggest tailoring it to a specific DB you have in mind.
2017-12-25 20:38:38	dsmith47	What's the use case?
2017-12-25 20:40:05	camila.g.carballo.1	mess around with sql commands 
2017-12-25 20:40:22	camila.g.carballo.1	that's what we did with tim
2017-12-25 20:41:00	tburchfi	dsmith47: I was looking at storing the open/place stuff.
2017-12-25 20:41:19	tburchfi	I'm reading the databases textbook but everything i've gotten to so far is very theoretical.
2017-12-25 20:45:32	dsmith47	If I didn't document it, I was gonna do a firebase integration because all instances of the app should update on every state change.

2017-12-27 16:58:23	dsmith47	Always be hypin'
2017-12-27 17:02:07	dsmith47	Since this project is modular, we're super open to feature ideas as well as fulfilling known issues, so ping away in #devkit and here
2017-12-27 17:42:55	tburchfi	wait, so /join #devkit
2017-12-27 17:42:58	tburchfi	oops
2017-12-27 23:03:34	dsmith47	@tburchfi should cursello code be functional python? I'm implementing a logger for the code checks and need to know if it should be a class or family of functions.
2017-12-27 23:05:08	tburchfi	Hmmm...functional sounds good, unless you see a big reason classes fit the bill better.
2017-12-27 23:05:25	tburchfi	Should we move to a #cursello ? I'll see if I can make it from within weechat
2017-12-27 23:15:37	dsmith47	Sounds good to me boss.
