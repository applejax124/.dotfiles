2017-10-23 10:58:05	ccarball	c'est officiel
2017-10-23 10:59:14	catvajiac	oui, vraiment officiel
2017-10-23 13:21:13	dougsmith	Est-ce officialement toujours en francais?
2017-10-23 13:38:57	ccarball	oui
2017-10-23 13:39:19	ccarball	okay but for real, hw5 is due next thursday (so we have time thats fine)
2017-10-23 13:40:07	ccarball	dougsmith: cat and I were looking at the schedule at there are 2 assignments (hw6 and lab3) due the same day as her comp (11/14) so I told her not to worry about those two cause we would take care of them.. that's fine, right?
2017-10-23 13:56:11	dougsmith	Totally. Can do. Glad we have time. I will say that 3 of the next 4 weeks are football games and the 4th is scarlet hacks, so if I know what my part is/ I can start things early, I plan on doing that before I disappear.
2017-10-23 14:02:57	ccarball	okok
2017-10-23 15:07:48	catvajiac	yeah we will plan, i would still like to contribute to hw6 and lab3 but priority will be lower 5sure
2017-10-23 16:12:11	dougsmith	As it should be.
2017-10-23 16:12:17	dougsmith	Not worried about it.

2017-11-01 20:50:12	ccarball	Okay so I'm probably just stupid and don't know what I'm doing, but I got a completely different answer for 1a and 1b
2017-11-01 20:58:52	ccarball	okay yeah no now that im looking at it, i think you guys calculated blocks for l1 data, not sets
2017-11-01 21:37:52	ccarball	for 2e: I think you have an extra 0 in x. I believe it should be 3.57%
2017-11-01 21:43:22	dougsmith	1A: also have 2^6 sets and 2^9 blocks
2017-11-01 21:44:04	dougsmith	Which propagates to 1B
2017-11-01 21:45:19	dougsmith	1C: Do we agree that 4.66 CCs qualifies as masking expensive memory operations?
2017-11-01 21:47:35	ccarball	well if its being compared to 4, if the average is 4.6(86)or 4.6(64) then that masks the miss penalty of 100 to main memory
2017-11-01 21:47:36	ccarball	right?
2017-11-01 21:47:43	ccarball	thats how i thought about it atlast
2017-11-01 21:49:08	dougsmith	I think so, but democracy requires voting on things before they become facts.
2017-11-01 21:49:30	ccarball	fsck democracy. this is a dictatorship.
2017-11-01 21:51:10	dougsmith	Good luck getting that to go over.
2017-11-01 21:56:43	dougsmith	For L2 in 2B: since 2^12< 3 * 2^11 < 2^13, does the index need to be 13?
2017-11-01 21:59:02	ccarball	hm
2017-11-01 22:05:08	dougsmith	2e: getting 3.57%
2017-11-01 22:30:27	ccarball	3d: 3,8 are spatial, but 6 is temporal ccause it was the first element that was asked for from that set
2017-11-01 22:30:46	dougsmith	^
2017-11-01 23:05:51	catvajiac	2e, also getting 3.57%
2017-11-01 23:06:48	catvajiac	i agree with 3d, 6 being temporal

2017-11-14 20:54:19	ccarball	okay but seriously
2017-11-14 20:54:23	ccarball	wtf is going on
2017-11-14 20:56:46	dougsmith	On the assignment? It looks like Project 1 is all modifying a matrix multiply to track memory usage
2017-11-14 20:59:37	dougsmith	I'm also assuming we can treat the cache as empty at the start of the multiplication.
2017-11-14 21:01:24	ccarball	dougsmith: is direct mapped == fully associative?
2017-11-14 21:03:07	dougsmith	Yes
2017-11-14 21:03:18	dougsmith	1 set ==== 1 block

2017-12-01 12:52:29	dougsmith	When would everyone be free to finish up the comparch lab? Niemier couldn't help me with the unexpected behavior in Part C so I want to leave Monday open for follow-up questions on that.
2017-12-01 22:10:23	catvajiac	would peeps be free sunday morning to work
2017-12-01 22:10:35	catvajiac	b/c if so, i can stay at nd saturday night, and then we can work of stuffs

2017-12-02 13:56:18	dougsmith	Sorry, just turned on IRC. I'm free whenever/wherever Sunday Morning
2017-12-02 13:56:53	dougsmith	It'd be cool to get Parts A and B done for sure, even if we can't troubleshoot part C
2017-12-02 14:07:25	catvajiac	agreed
2017-12-02 14:07:41	catvajiac	ccarball: does jess have futon or something? [cc: ccarball]

2017-12-02 14:09:21	ccarball	she has little chairs
2017-12-02 14:09:26	ccarball	no futon
2017-12-02 14:26:23	catvajiac	damn
2017-12-02 14:51:46	dougsmith	Does jess need a futon?
2017-12-02 15:09:42	catvajiac	it's fine, maybe i wont stay
2017-12-02 15:09:57	catvajiac	we can do stuffs in the evening in that case
2017-12-02 15:12:56	dougsmith	Like comp_arch stuffs?
2017-12-02 15:13:07	dougsmith	Or fun stuffs?
2017-12-02 15:24:32	catvajiac	i was thinking comp arch
2017-12-02 15:24:36	catvajiac	but if we get done, fun stuffs
2017-12-02 15:30:38	dougsmith	Fun after work...
2017-12-02 15:30:42	dougsmith	is motivated
2017-12-02 15:32:05	ccarball	meh
2017-12-02 15:32:59	ccarball	dougsmith: do u have a sleeping bag? << for catvajiac 
2017-12-02 15:36:26	dougsmith	Yep.
2017-12-02 15:36:39	dougsmith	Or I could just move my futon to a girls' dorm
2017-12-02 15:36:54	dougsmith	It's easier than it sounds
2017-12-02 15:42:25	ccarball	futon wont fit in either of our rooms
2017-12-02 15:42:57	dougsmith	Can't measure, so I'll take your word for it.
2017-12-02 15:43:09	dougsmith	has never had a single to furnish
2017-12-02 15:44:55	ccarball	cause if i can borrow your sleeping bag then catvajiac can sleep on my bed
2017-12-02 15:45:25	ccarball	also, I have to do some grading for corey then im gonna take a look at lab again
2017-12-02 15:51:56	dougsmith	All the section B code should be on gitlab. Still have to fininshed the windowed multiply. Section C straight-up hasn't worked the way the lab says it should, so I emailed Niemier
2017-12-02 15:52:29	ccarball	okay, is A finished except for q2?
2017-12-02 15:52:38	ccarball	Cause i can read up on that paper and answer that
2017-12-02 15:58:13	dougsmith	I have a gut answer to Q2, which is yes, but I hesitate to write it b/c he advises us to do B first for added insights... like q2 is a trick question or something... I'm curious what B will tell us
2017-12-02 15:58:38	ccarball	okie we wait then
2017-12-02 15:59:10	dougsmith	Sorry...
