2017-12-09 22:30:45	kdodson	hey guys I was just checking over the databases project requirements... it says we need to "Show how to search the database and list or print returned results. You need to show a few different interesting queries over your database. *One of the queries must involve join of multiple tables.* " does anyone remember if they did multiple joins lol
2017-12-09 22:32:01	kdodson	Also: "You need to send a zip file containing all your project files to Rachel (rkrohn@nd.edu mailto:rkrohn@nd.edu ) before the final deadline. Please put "CSE30246-Project Files:: YOUR *TEAM* NAME" in the subject. Also name the zip file as "Your Team Name".zip. you will lose up to 5 points for not submitting your files.
2017-12-09 22:32:01	kdodson	Remember your final report is due Dec. 15th, 2017 at 10am. Simply link or attach your final report to your project details page."
2017-12-09 23:13:42	jcioffi	i didnt do the join, but i think we had to do a join for the replacements because we had to do the group number comparisons for replacements, and then based off of the valid groups return who could be available to work.  @ivywang would know more about that though I think
2017-12-09 23:22:30	kdodson	we just might need to come up with a table join lol, I checked what Ivy and I did for the shift replacements and I don't see joins...maybe a page where firemen can find their shifts based on their firefighter id? idk
2017-12-09 23:31:58	kdodson	we could do something like Select id, name, groupNum, shiftid, date from Firefighter, Shifts where Firefighter.groupNum = Shifts.group1 or Firefighter.groupNum = Shifts.group2....and firefighterid=$whateverIDchosen order by date asc;
2017-12-10 15:03:41	ivywang	I donâ€™t remember using join anywhere
2017-12-10 15:06:23	kdodson	does anyone maybe want to talk to Weninger with me about it tomorrow? maybe tell him what info we have in our tables and get a suggestion of what to join and output?
2017-12-10 15:06:40	ivywang	I can join you
2017-12-10 15:07:00	kdodson	haha JOIN you :nerd_face:
2017-12-10 15:07:21	ivywang	:joy:
2017-12-10 16:07:59	kdodson	he's going to be in his office until 3 tomorrow
2017-12-10 16:11:23	ivywang	Awesome
2017-12-10 18:33:12	jcioffi	i have 2 finals tomorrow, when were you guys planning on going over?
2017-12-10 18:33:52	ccarball	i have a final and grading to do tomorrow, but i might be able to join depending on the time
2017-12-10 20:08:29	kdodson	Not sure yet maybe around noon... but no worries if you can't come. It'll be a short meeting
2017-12-11 10:13:50	kdodson	when is everyone's finals today?
2017-12-11 10:14:11	kdodson	also good luck if you're about to go into a test :shamrock:
2017-12-11 13:36:35	kdodson	so we just had a brief meeting with Weninger... he said not to worry about the multiple table join. He thinks we already fulfilled requirements. Now we just have to fill out the report and email them/send them a .zip file of our entire project
2017-12-11 17:17:53		[ccarball back: gone 00:00:09]
2017-12-14 18:57:26	kdodson	@channel just checking in, how is the writeup and everything? Is everything sent to the TAs, or does something still need to be done? [cc: ccarball]
2017-12-14 19:04:13	ccarball	I was gonna ask if anyone sent the files to weninger...
2017-12-14 19:05:00	kdodson	Yeah you're our Team manager/captain! So I think you will need to send the files when you're ready
2017-12-14 19:05:25	kdodson	I think you just have to send a ZIP file to the TAs and Weninger or something... It's on the project description.
2017-12-14 19:05:39	kdodson	Also I checked and we still need to finish the final report!
2017-12-14 19:07:38	kdodson	It looks like questions 3, 4, and 5 need to be finished.
2017-12-14 19:09:41	ccarball	okay great I can send the files
2017-12-14 19:10:17	ccarball	it looks like we have to attach the report to our projecct details page on the site
2017-12-14 19:15:15	ccarball	(idk how to do that)
2017-12-14 19:19:53	kdodson	You can use an html link on the project details page (here is the Google Doc's Shareable Link: https://docs.google.com/a/nd.edu/document/d/1lPCR30sxxF_xYOaT_so8bZ35lFqXgpUG0QW6Qt8lOXk/edit?usp=sharing 
2017-12-14 19:21:59	kdodson	A link is just like <a href="URL">Final Report</a> something like that
2017-12-14 19:31:05	kdodson	Also i just realized... should we give instructions on how to sign in as admin (username: admin, password: admin) ?
2017-12-14 20:18:58	ccarball	everything is in!
2017-12-14 20:19:01	ccarball	we are gucci fam
